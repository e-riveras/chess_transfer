It’s an opening which can be traced right back to that great English player of the Victorian era, Howard Staunton. Wherever possible we’ll also be looking to put to good use a set-up within the English favoured by the legendary fifth world champion, ‘the Patriarch’, Mikhail Botvinnik. The world hasn’t been an amazing place of late, but lockdown allowed time for plenty of filming, streaming...and internet blitz.

Bolder readers will no doubt be looking at ideas of Kg2, Rh1 and a sacrifice on g5 here; calmer ones will notice how tied up Black is, so why not open a second front on the queenside as White? Centralising the king, not for the endgame, but to allow the rooks access to the h-file. This is a dream Botvinnik position. White has a handy space advantage and just look at Black’s lack of coordination and counterplay. Simon recalls he was very happy here, and no wonder. Keeping pieces on and Black bottled up.

Giving up control of e5 should never be done lightly, but here White is well placed to expand on the kingside before Black can organise any real counterplay. A bold but by no means bad reaction.

Ruling out Bg5. would reveal White’s main idea. Yes, Black can unpin easily enough, but after White has a fairly harmonious set-up and may play to open up the bishop on g2: for example, ( is necessary when keeps Black afloat) . This is an important advance, stymieing Black’s play. Just observe how ...f4 is no longer possible and which bishop is the more powerful? Black might try , but after ( is also quite tempting) White will regain his pawn with a clear advantage, as with ( exploits Black’s uncoordinated pieces) when White’s bishop is clearly superior to the knight. White might follow up with Rac1 and b4 or look to double on the e-file. Before we return to the main game, do note too that White should rarely worry about an exchange on d5 in such positions. Here ( is also tempting, and if , that cramping pawn advance once again) keeps control and a small edge, while the critical line is , enabling Black to challenge with ...c6. A risky advance because pawns can’t, of course, move backwards. Opening up the bishop on g2, but Simon would have preferred , hoping for when the position suddenly opens to White’s advantage. You might worry about all the possible pawn exchanges here, but White has e4 and f4 overprotected, and just which king is likely to prove the weaker? would echo the game. After Black is a pawn up, but following White has far more than enough compensation. Just look at Black’s extremely weak light squares! White may well just double on the c-file, but at some point Be4-b1 followed by Qd3 might also be a plan. As there was no reason to fear a sacrifice on g4, ( keeps control) or just was the way to maintain control. White will play to make good use of the unfurled (or should that be unfurloughed?) bishop on g2, with Rab1 and b4-b5, and that gaping hole on f5 may come back to haunt Black one day. Falling in with White’s plans. was another idea, looking to leave both black bishops blunted if , but would have given Black some counterplay. Black can’t resist the free pawn. Snatching it doesn’t turn out well for him, but would also be pretty unpleasant, with Ng3 on its way. A little rushed. was the way to maintain control, intending Rac1 and b4, or if when even Kg2, f3, Rh1 and h4 might be a plan. would still have supplied decent compensation, as you can quickly see from a comparison of the bishops. Suddenly Black has freed his position and has two pawns for the exchange. Again Black can’t resist a pawn, but he certainly wouldn’t have been worse after , refusing to open lines for White’s rooks. By this point Black had three pawns for the exchange, but his vulnerable light squares were the key feature of the position. White continued to retain control while bagging a pawn and after Richard was well on his way to victory. Gradual Expansion } ) *

{ Game 5, Clutch Chess (rapid) 2020, where Black had a handy lead in development, but was struggling to do much with it due to his current lack of a pawn break. Magnus continued in creative and ambitious fashion: ( would be sensible when after the chances are about level in a very rich and unbalanced position, where White should be looking to break with f4) and now would have been extremely unclear. In a fast game it wouldn’t be at all easy to work out how to free Black’s position and, of course, he must avoid on account of the simple and deadly . When did you last see two rooks doubled so quickly on an open h-file? Magnus first unveiled in the first game of his rapid play-off with Fabiano Caruana at the end of their world championship match in London. Fabiano went for immediate counterplay with , but after White’s central pressure was the main feature of the position. Now did leave Black a pawn ahead, but with a queenside riddled with holes. Here one simple route to a very pleasant advantage is (Magnus preferred and went on to secure a very important victory) ( is quite awkward for Black; just look at those holes and note that fails to ) . Black has managed to cling on to his extra c-pawn, but f5 is a large threat and one not so easy to meet. Indeed, even (or when Black has weaknesses right across the board) is quite awkward for him, and if . It’s rare that White gets to take over the centre so, but our favourite e4 and f4 Botvinnik pawns really can pack a powerful punch at many times, and here do also enjoy the sight of those two powerful bishops on e3 and g2! Prophylaxis against ...Bg4. White simply wants to get his king to safety on the kingside and then expand with the f4 break. One point of White’s move order is that he can, of course, recapture after with the knight, but is also quite tempting, especially if it leads to ( is a better try, but White does have followed by d3, 0-0 and f4) . Once again we see Black with a lead in development, but also under heavy pressure already, with his bishop proving something of a target on e6. Now would just be a dream and free attack for White. Keeping control rather than allow Black far too much activity for a pawn with . Black reroutes his bishop to a more active diagonal, but he won’t be able to tactically prevent f4 for ever. Freeing the f-pawn for action, but it’s important not to rush with f4 here. Magnus wants to retain control of the position, not rush into , which just feels very unclear. He may also have been concerned about the possibility of , which is a tactical motif we advise you to file away and never allow – in a strong guise! Here White can, though, defend with when Black shouldn’t have enough for his piece with Qg3 next up. It’s time to apply a spot of pressure and central play is, of course, very justified in response to Black’s queenside attack. was also possible, though, and if . This position isn’t so easy to assess, but we must admit that we quite like White. After f5 followed by g4 Black may simply find himself in huge danger on the kingside before he’s obtained too much on the queenside. Naturally Magnus doesn’t fall for when would be horrific for White, but as well as the creative text, was very much an option, getting ready to go f4, which will place e5 and f6 under some pressure.

Black also would have suffered after , keeping full control, when his attempts to generate something on the kingside come to naught, and would again leave White with much the better bishop and even ideas of an eventual f4-f5. A strong advance. White is all set to rip open the queenside with a5 (notice how the bishop on g2 is well placed to support a rook invasion on b7), and while Black can grab the a-pawn without losing d6 in the process, doing so comes at a certain cost. Taimanov continues to grab as many pawns as he can in return for his suffering. The alternative was when would have left White with superb compensation. It’s notable that both Stockfish and Lc0 have White as being up by well over a pawn here, and they’re quite right, of course. In short, White has the far superior bishop and the only mobile pawn majority, his three holding Black’s five on the queenside.

{ Game 8, Clutch Chess (rapid) ) transposes to a position we’ll consider shortly after in variation ‘b’. a4) was tried by Magnus himself no less when Peter Svidler went for the mirror approach as they clashed in the Legends of Chess event: and now Peter the Great returned the extra pawn with , which was sensible enough, if not definitely better than . Here (Magnus was presumably ready to improve at this juncture; after we wouldn’t be too unhappy with quick kingside expansion under way, so maybe is critical, intending and , so White should probably go with a strategically complex position in need of a test or three – again White is ready to play on the kingside and avoids being overrun on the other flank, since White can meet with ) was quite a powerful pawn sacrifice in Gordon-Congiu, Barcelona 2019, where Black found herself getting crushed after ( would also be rather nice for White) ( would have restricted White to a pleasant edge) , which prepared Bh3 and a brutal kingside attack, as occurred with and that was already pretty much that. b) reaches the older ( ) lines and in a version long considered pleasant enough for White: (standard; play generally transposes after , and left Black with a dead-point on d4 and White pleasantly better on both flanks in Smyslov-Karesev, USSR Championship, Leningrad 1971) (conceding a tempo to bring the bishop to a much better square; once again, a great many moves have been tried here, but in general White should be fine so long as he sticks to the standard Botvinnik approach: for example, seized the initiative in El Debs-Do Valle Cardoso, Florianopolis 2020, , as in Rahman-Hasan, Dhaka 2012, should be met by followed by f4, and, finally, will transpose if Black now retreats his bishop to c5, which he didn’t in Harikrishna-L’Ami, Cochin 2004, where and then would have been a pleasant edge for White) . This keeps Black out of g4 as the position resembles a modern Vienna, but one where White has some extra central control thanks to our first move: (going for some counterplay; otherwise, Black can just get crushed in standard Botvinnik fashion, as was the case after in Blanco Gramajo-Dunwoody, correspondence 2003) (ruling out Bg5 ideas; alternatively, was Miezis-Gomez, Elgoibar 1995, where would have supplied an edge, intending Bb2, Qc2 and Rae1, did likewise in Turner-Karlsen, Tromso 2009, where left Black being completely strategically outplayed, and , as in Klekowski-Wojtaszek, Chorzow (blitz) 2019, and then might well be a little better for White, since the dark-squared bishop can emerge on g5, b2 or even a3) (stepping off the g1-a7 diagonal to thematically prepare f4) (once again, can be met by not just , but also , a useful ploy to keep Black’s queenside play in check, as is the case after when would already be a strategic disaster for Black) . This is clearly not that hard a line for White to play and here that great Botvinnik expert, the Latvian GM Normunds Miezis likes to go . We also quite like , intending ( can be met in similar fashion with or even when in Ortiz Suarez-Gomez Garrido, Bogota 2012, would have maintained the bind and an edge, while would, of course, leave Black with a dead-point on d4 and White able to edge forwards on both flanks) when it’s not so easy to free Black’s position, as can be seen from when Black actually isn’t up to too much down the g1-a7 diagonal, while White is ready to go Bb2 and then Ba3 or d4. After castling is by no means forced, but plugs the hole on d4, while still leaving White in control of d5 and, for example, (keeping any counterplay under control, while intending the good, old plan of 0-0, h3 and f4) would have been a strategic nightmare for Black in Bocharov-Khismatullin, Sochi (rapid) 2019, had White now spotted followed by Ng3. Otherwise, can be well enough met by , can be met by Sorokin’s or just , freeing the f-pawn for action, and left Black being badly squashed in Gulko-Miralles, Cannes 1987. c) Black’s remaining moves are actually extremely rare, but makes some sense, angling for a quick ...d5, although White can put the kibosh on that with ( is also possible if you don’t mind a reasonable IQP position after an exchange on d5) (we saw in the note ‘b’ above that is quite pleasant for White) (Black is hoping for a transposition to the older line ) before she changed approach with in Kulon-Grigorian, Pardubice 2013. Now it was possible to target d6 or even to hit it straight away with , and if . d) has only been tried twice so far, but ( doesn’t transpose to our main line, as there White doesn’t hurry with Bg2, so here makes sense, intending the usual d3, Ne2, 0-0, h3 and f4) brings about a position which can arise from a few different move orders. Here White should avoid as it rather walks into , but might be considered, while ( can now, of course, just be met by followed by Kh2 and 0-0) was Ivanisevic-Donchenko, Barcelona 2019. Now we quite like , and if , keeping the f4 break in reserve, with White possibly set to first go Bh3 and h5.

White eventually ground out the win after and would have been a decent alternative, retaining control of the queenside, while preparing to advance on the kingside. At the top level, Black’s most popular choice has actually been an immediate gain of space with and here (we’ll see by transposition below, while was Gukesh-Barsegyan, Cannes 2020, where White didn’t have to rush with , and might have gone – going long is surely too risky with a pawn on a4 – followed by Bd3, after which White might push f4 after all or perhaps regroup with Bc1 and Nd1-e3) (Black should probably avoid if only because left him playing for two results in Van Wely-Nguyen, 1st matchgame, Novy Bor 2019, where might have been even stronger than grabbing the pawn) saw White setting up in ideal fashion for the line in Carlsen-Anand, Karlsruhe 2019, which we’ll return to shortly. Once again, we see this unusual, but decent development of the knight and, lest it helps, ...f6 and ...Nh6-f7 is by no means unknown in the Bxc6 dxc6 lines of the Rossolimo Sicilian. Yet again we see Black wanting to go ...Be6 without allowing Ng5 in return, or possibly worried by a timely Bg5. Sergey Karjakin preferred ( is tempting too, with Black having delayed ...a5) and now in Carlsen-Karjakin, Abidjan (blitz) 2019, would have been sensible, intending (Black should probably prepare this with when after White might even be able to follow up Qe2 with b3 and 0-0-0) (to avoid losing a pawn) (but not ) followed by Bh3 with a lasting pull thanks to White’s more mobile kingside pawns and the potential hole (for a rook or knight) on d5. Once again, Black has also tried when (provoking a weakness) was seen in V.Georgiev-Jovanic, Ljubljana 2003. There White didn’t need to rush ahead on the kingside, but might have begun with only intending to advance the g- and h-pawns after . And, finally, was all very thematic in So-Mamedyarov, Bucharest (rapid) 2019, where ( would actually transpose to a position we’ll see in the notes to Black’s 10th move in Carlsen-Anand) (the ideal push for Black in the older line, activity being more important than any classical notion about opening the board only helping White’s bishop-pair; Mamedyarov actually preferred when was sensible, intending f4 or , perhaps followed by doubling on the d-file and/or a well-timed g4) would have been thematic. However, after White cannot be too unhappy with his bishops and a space-gaining c4 on the cards. Already White is perfectly able to make such an advance with Black, whilst very solidly placed, not exactly enjoying much early counterplay. Mysterious, but the idea soon becomes apparent. Too greedy. was indicated, leaving everything to play for after , although after to facilitate Ne3-d5 White must have an edge with Black largely so passive. Unfortunately this strong leap was missed in Berkes-Lafuente, Khanty-Mansiysk Olympiad 2010, and after Black might well have found himself objectively lost with Rdh1 next up and not exactly helping matters. } *

As such, he should probably try ( was preferred in Akermann-Rusev, Zurich 2008, where White was content to immediately regain his pawn; he might also have considered when the computer displays its favourite ‘0.00’, but in practice we would certainly take White with gxf6 gxf6; Rg1 on the way, as well as Nxb7) when keeps the bishop active ( should also be considered), and after it might be possible to make something out of the queenside majority in the resulting endgame. Black’s knights look good, but he must now weaken and use a tempo if he wants to prevent g4 from driving them backwards. is probably a better way to offer to return the pawn. White can accept or try to grind away after , hoping to get in Bd4 and/or g5. We’ve followed the encounter Svane-Donchenko, German Championship, Saarbruecken 2015, where would have fought for space on the kingside and left White slightly for choice.
