1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d6 3. g3 g6
{ Black decides to go for a King’s Indian set-up after all. Instead, 3...e5 4.Bg2 Nbd7 5.d3 Be7 would resemble the Old Indian. After 6.e4 Black looks a little cramped and our favourite f4 advance might well occur. }
4. Bg2 Bg7 5. e4
{ There are several different ways of handling the English, but naturally we advocate setting up that Botvinnik formation. }
5... e5 6. Nge2 Nc6 7. O-O O-O 8. f4 $5
{ 8.d3 is our recommended move order, but the young Simon liked the immediate, bold advance of Freddie. }
8... Be6
{ Routine development, just as you might expect at club level. 8...exf4! 9.gxf4 Nh5 is somewhat more challenging. Black prepares to gain space of his own with ...f5 and 10.f5? Qh4 would leave White looking rather overextended. }
9. Nd5 $6
{ White should still go 9.d3 when Black might well elect to prevent f5 with 9...Qd7. Now 10.Nd5 looks sensible, but we also can’t resist pointing out that 10.f5!? gxf5 11.Bg5 is a very interesting pawn sacrifice. If Black takes on e4, White wins material, so 11...Ne8 seems necessary (11...h6? 12.Bxf6 Bxf6 13.exf5 Bxf5 14.g4! wins a piece – a tactical motif worth remembering), when 12.exf5 Bxf5 13.Nd5 leaves White with a certain grip and compensation for the pawn; Qd2 will follow and quite possibly Ne2-c3-e4. }
9... Ne8 $2
{ Far too meek. King’s Indian players always want to free their f-pawn to go ...f5, but Black won’t be able to because of our set-up. Much better was 9...Bg4, making good use of Black’s grip on the d4-square, which is the one downside to the Botvinnik formation. }
10. f5 $1 { Put that in your pipe and smoke it! } 10... Bd7
{ 10...Bxd5 11.cxd5 is almost never a trade to worry about. After 11...Nd4 (or 11...Ne7 12.d3 when 12...c6 is a break for freedom, but after 13.dxc6 bxc6 14.g4! White is much better; Ng3 follows and Black is in grave danger of being squashed to death on the kingside) 12.Nxd4 exd4 13.d3 White has a pleasant advantage. Black’s pawn on d4 is something of a dead point, merely blunting his own bishop, in contrast to which White has control, a space advantage, the two bishops and, yes, g4-g5 may follow. }
11. d3
{ Having made such a gain of space, it’s high time to develop the remaining pieces. }
11... f6
{ This is ugly, but so is the best the engines can suggest, 11...h6 12.Be3 g5. Just look at that bishop on g7! Indeed, with Black devoid of counterplay and so cramped it might make sense for White to switch operations and expand with 13.b4. Note that while our Botvinnik set-up does leave the f-pawn free to advance, we are by no means committed to kingside play, but can also advance on the queenside and sometimes even in the centre. }
12. Be3 Ne7 13. Nxe7+
{ Simon remembers also being tempted by 13.g4 and 13.d4!? looks very nice too for White with Qb3 next up. }
13... Qxe7 14. Qd2 g5 $2
{ Black wrongly thinks that Bh6 is a threat. That is often a plan to swap off one of Black’s best pieces, but here the entombed bishop on g7 cannot be seen as one. 14...c6 was a try for some counterplay, but after 15.g4 Nc7 16.Ng3 White retains control and might even ready Harry, while 14...c5 15.g4 (a good case can even be made for 15.b4!?) 15...a6 16.h4! b5 17.Ng3 Rb8 18.g5 is a very instructive line. Naturally Black doesn’t want to take on f5 or g5, but he is just in huge trouble in any case, as shown by 18...Nc7 19.Rf2 Rb7 20.Raf1. The pressure grows against f6 and 20...Ne8 21.fxg6! (only now, with all White’s pieces perfectly aligned) 21...hxg6 22.h5 decisively rips open lines: for example, 22...fxg5 (or 22...gxh5 23.g6 followed by Nxh5 or even Nf5 and Qe2) 23.Rxf8+ Bxf8 24.hxg6 Qg7 25.Qf2 Be7 26.Nf5 Bxf5 27.Qxf5 and Black collapses on the light squares. }
15. g4 $1 { Preventing any notion of ...h5 while freeing g3 for the knight. }
15... Rf7 16. h4 $1
{ It was again possible to switch focus with 16.b4, but with Black so tied up, Simon couldn’t resist involving Harry. }
16... h6
{ 16...gxh4? 17.Rf3 will regain the pawn with a mighty attack after Rh3. } 17.
hxg5 hxg5
{ 17...fxg5 might have been more obstinate, but still looks great for White after 18.Bf3 Nf6 19.Ng3. Bolder readers will no doubt be looking at ideas of Kg2, Rh1 and a sacrifice on g5 here; calmer ones will notice how tied up Black is, so why not open a second front on the queenside as White? }
18. Kf2 $1
{ Centralising the king, not for the endgame, but to allow the rooks access to the h-file. }
18... c6 19. Rh1 Nc7 20. Rh3 Rff8 21. Rah1 Kf7 22. Ng3
{ This is a dream Botvinnik position. White has a handy space advantage and just look at Black’s lack of coordination and counterplay. Simon recalls he was very happy here, and no wonder. }
22... Rh8 23. Nh5 $1 { Keeping pieces on and Black bottled up. } 23... Bh6 24.
d4
{ Levering open the second front, but we’re not sure now how Simon resisted 24.Nxf6!, and if 24...Qxf6 25.Rxh6 Rxh6 26.Bxg5 and it’s all over. }
24... c5 $2
{ Desperation. 24...exd4 25.Bxd4 Ne8 26.Nf4! is one neat way to invade, and 24...Bg7 actually fails to prevent 25.Nxf6! and – boom! After 25...Bxf6 (25...Qxf6 26.Bxg5 traps the black queen) 26.Rh7+ Bg7 27.Bxg5 Qe8 28.f6 White wins material while decisively opening lines. }
25. dxc5 dxc5 26. Nxf6 $1 { Simon was never going to miss this for long. }
26... Bxf5 27. exf5 Rad8 28. Nd5 e4 29. Nxe7 Rxd2+ 30. Bxd2 1-0

1. e4 g6 2. c4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. g3 Nf6 5. Bg2 O-O 6. Nge2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. f4
{ Once again we see Simon’s old favourite, but you should really prefer 8.d3. }
8... Nd4 $6
{ This leap is a fairly common reaction from Black in this structure, but White should rarely mind it as Black will likely be hampered by his resulting dead point on d4. Once again, Black should prefer 8...exf4!, and if 9.gxf4 Nh5 to free his position. }
9. d3 c6 10. Nxd4
{ Creating the aforementioned dead point. 10.h3 is also reasonable enough, but after 10...Nxe2+ 11.Nxe2 exf4 12.Nxf4 (12.Bxf4 Nh5 is a bit annoying, as is 12.gxf4?! Nh5 followed by ...f5 and/or ...Qh4) 12...Re8 Black may be OK. }
10... exd4 11. Ne2 Nd7 $6
{ The wrong way. Black needed to exploit the absence of one our favourite moves, h3, with the brave 11...Ng4! and after 12.h3 Ne3 13.Bxe3 dxe3 14.d4 (if 14.Qc1 Qb6) 14...c5 matters would have been extremely murky. }
12. f5 $1
{ Giving up control of e5 should never be done lightly, but here White is well placed to expand on the kingside before Black can organise any real counterplay. }
12... g5 $5
{ A bold but by no means bad reaction. Black wants to keep lines closed and be able to exploit his control of e5. The downside is that he’s created a hook on g5 for White’s attack. Instead, 12...Ne5 13.h3 looks quite pleasant for White, and it’s also possible to be bold and grab: 13.Nxd4!? Qb6 14.Be3 Qxb2 (or 14...Ng4?! 15.Qxg4 Bxd4 16.Bxd4 Qxd4+ 17.Kh1 Qxb2 18.Qh4 when Black’s dark squares are creaking quite badly) 15.Rb1 Qxa2 16.f6 Bh8 17.h3 and that’s one unhappy bishop on h8. The knight might also come out via 12...Nc5, but then White might simply sound the charge: 13.h4! when 13...a5 (13...d5!? would classically counter the flank attack in the centre; it is an improvement, although White is still slightly for choice after 14.cxd5 cxd5 15.Bg5) 14.Bg5 f6 (14...Bf6 15.Qd2 looks like a nice attacking set-up) 15.Bc1! leaves Black with not just one, but two rather restricted bishops. }
13. b3
{ Simon decides to remind Black that d4 can become weak. 13.Kh1!? is another very interesting idea, preparing to regroup the knight with Ng1-f3. }
13... c5 14. g4 { Here we go... } 14... h6 15. Ng3 Rb8
{ A little slow perhaps. Black should have preferred 15...Be5!? or 15...Ne5, and if 16.h4 b5! 17.cxb5 a6 with Benko Gambit-like counterplay. }
16. h4 $1 gxh4 $2
{ Far too greedy. 16...b5 was still indicated when we slightly prefer White after 17.hxg5 hxg5 18.cxb5 Rxb5 19.Nh5, but it is, of course, very much a case of game on. }
17. Nh5 Nf6 $2
{ This only encourages White’s attack. If 17...Ne5 there’s 18.f6!, based on the point 18...Bxg4 19.Qd2! Bxh5? 20.fxg7 Kxg7 21.Qxh6+ and wins, while after 17...b5 Simon was ready with 18.cxb5 Rxb5 19.g5!, crashing through in view of 19...hxg5 20.Nxg7 Kxg7? 21.f6+ Kg6 22.Qg4 with a winning attack. }
18. g5 $1 Nh7
{ The best of a bad bunch. 18...hxg5 19.Bxg5 creates a fatal pin and 18...Nxh5 19.Qxh5 hxg5 20.Bxg5 is already all over in view of 20...f6 (or 20...Bf6 21.Bh6) 21.e5! fxg5 22.Bd5+ followed by mate. }
19. f6 Bh8 20. e5 $1
{ Bringing the Botvinnik bishop on g2 into play, although there was nothing much wrong with the immediate 20.gxh6. }
20... hxg5
{ After 20...dxe5 21.gxh6 White threatens Be4 and there doesn’t appear to be any defence, as shown by 21...Nxf6 (or 21...Qd7 22.Kh2! Qg4 23.Qxg4+ Bxg4 24.Bd5! Bxh5 25.Rg1+ Bg7 when the computer’s 26.Bg5! is both neat and deadly) 22.Bg5 Bg4 (what else?) 23.Nxf6+ Bxf6 24.h7+ Kh8 25.Bxf6+ Qxf6 26.Rxf6 Bxd1 27.Rxd1 Kxh7 28.Rdf1 Kg7 29.Bd5 with an extra piece and easy win. }
21. Be4
{ The 2020 version of the Ginger GM would surely have spotted 21.Bxg5!, having studied so many games by his favourite player, Mikhail Tal, as well as The Art of Attack in Chess. Black is simply getting crushed as after 21...Nxg5 22.Qd2 the attack is overwhelming: 22...Nh7 (22...Ne6 23.Be4 dxe5 24.Qh6 mates and 22...Nh3+ 23.Kh1 will also be followed by Qh6) 23.Be4 Qd7 24.Qh6 Qg4+ 25.Kf2! Ng5 26.Bh7+! (and not 26.Rg1?? Nh3+) 26...Nxh7 27.Rg1 when the attack down the g-file is clearly a decisive one. }
21... dxe5 $2
{ He would still have been facing a strong attack, but Black needed to take his chances in 21...Re8 22.Nf4! (22.Bxh7+ Kxh7 23.Nf4 g4! keeps lines relatively closed) 22...Nxf6! (22...gxf4 23.Bxh7+ Kxh7 24.Qh5+ Kg8 25.Kf2 is another decisive clearing of the g-file) 23.exf6 gxf4 24.Rxf4. }
22. Bxh7+ $1
{ Unfortunately Simon missed this blow and 22.Qf3? Qd7! began a cruel turning of the tables, with Black winning in 50 moves. }
22... Kxh7 23. Ng7 $1 Kg8
{ 23...Bxg7 24.Qh5+! is an important check followed by Bxg5 or 24...Kg8 25.Qxg5 and wins. }

1. c4 e5 2. g3
{ In this game Richard fianchettoed immediately, but we would recommend the move order 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2. }
2... Nc6 3. Bg2 g6 4. Nc3 Bg7 5. e4 d6 6. Nge2 f5
{ Black decides to exploit his move order to break straight away, not transpose into King’s Indian lines with 6...Nf6. }
7. d3 Nf6 8. O-O O-O 9. Nd5
{ It’s certainly tempting to occupy the hole on d5 and prepare to pin with Bg5, but this is by no means White’s only move, and our repertoire recommendation is actually to exchange on f5 without delay. }
9... h6
{ Ruling out Bg5. 9...Be6 10.Bg5 would reveal White’s main idea. Yes, Black can unpin easily enough, but after 10...Qd7 11.Qd2 White has a fairly harmonious set-up and may play to open up the bishop on g2: for example, 11...Rae8 12.exf5!? gxf5? (12...Bxf5 is necessary when 13.Bxf6 Bxf6 14.Nxf6+ Rxf6 15.d4 Bh3 keeps Black afloat) 13.Bxf6! Bxf6 14.Nxf6+ Rxf6 15.f4!. This is an important advance, stymieing Black’s play. Just observe how ...f4 is no longer possible and which bishop is the more powerful? Black might try 15...e4, but after 16.dxe4 (16.Nc3 is also quite tempting) 16...fxe4 17.Rfe1 Bxc4 18.Nc3 White will regain his pawn with a clear advantage, as with 18...Bd3 (18...d5? 19.Nxe4 exploits Black’s uncoordinated pieces) 19.Nxe4 Bxe4 20.Bxe4 when White’s bishop is clearly superior to the knight. White might follow up with Rac1 and b4 or look to double on the e-file. Before we return to the main game, do note too that White should rarely worry about an exchange on d5 in such positions. Here 9...Nxd5 10.cxd5 (10.exd5!? is also tempting, and if 10...Ne7 11.f4, that cramping pawn advance once again) 10...Ne7 11.Be3 keeps control and a small edge, while the critical line is 9...Ne7!?, enabling Black to challenge with ...c6. }
10. Be3 g5 $6
{ A risky advance because pawns can’t, of course, move backwards. } 11. exf5
{ Opening up the bishop on g2, but Simon would have preferred 11.Nxf6+!?, hoping for 11...Bxf6?! 12.f4! when the position suddenly opens to White’s advantage. You might worry about all the possible pawn exchanges here, but White has e4 and f4 overprotected, and just which king is likely to prove the weaker? }
11... Bxf5 12. h3 Qd7
{ 12...Nxd5 13.cxd5 Nb4? would echo the game. After 14.g4! Bxd3?! 15.a3 Bxe2 16.Qxe2 Na6 Black is a pawn up, but following 17.Rac1 White has far more than enough compensation. Just look at Black’s extremely weak light squares! White may well just double on the c-file, but at some point Be4-b1 followed by Qd3 might also be a plan. }
13. Kh2
{ As there was no reason to fear a sacrifice on g4, 13.g4 (13...Nxg4? 14.hxg4 Bxg4 15.f3 Bh3 16.Ng3 keeps control) or just 13.Nxf6+ Bxf6 14.g4! Bg6 15.Ng3 was the way to maintain control. White will play to make good use of the unfurled (or should that be unfurloughed?) bishop on g2, with Rab1 and b4-b5, and that gaping hole on f5 may come back to haunt Black one day. }
13... Nxd5 14. cxd5 Nb4 $2
{ Falling in with White’s plans. 14...Ne7 15.d4 was another idea, looking to leave both black bishops blunted if 15...e4 16.Nc3, but 14...Nd4! 15.g4 Bg6 16.Ng3 c6 would have given Black some counterplay. }
15. g4 $1 Bxd3
{ Black can’t resist the free pawn. Snatching it doesn’t turn out well for him, but 15...Bg6 16.Be4! would also be pretty unpleasant, with Ng3 on its way. }
16. a3 Bxe2 17. Qxe2 Na6 18. Be4 $6
{ A little rushed. 18.Qc2! was the way to maintain control, intending Rac1 and b4, or if 18...Nc5 19.b4 Na4 20.Be4 when even Kg2, f3, Rh1 and h4 might be a plan. }
18... Nc5 19. Bf5 $6
{ 19.Bxc5 dxc5 20.Rac1 would still have supplied decent compensation, as you can quickly see from a comparison of the bishops. }
19... Rxf5 $1 20. gxf5 Qxf5
{ Suddenly Black has freed his position and has two pawns for the exchange. }
21. Qg4 Qf7 22. Rac1 Qxd5 $6
{ Again Black can’t resist a pawn, but he certainly wouldn’t have been worse after 22...Nd3!, refusing to open lines for White’s rooks. }

1. c4 g6 2. Nc3 Bg7 3. g3 d6 4. Bg2 e5 5. e4
{ Our favourite Botvinnik set-up and here we’ll see how White might build on some of the ideas we’ve already seen. }
5... Ne7 6. Nge2 O-O 7. O-O Nbc6 8. d3 Bg4
{ Black has kept his f-pawn free with this set-up, but 8...f5 9.Nd5 is nothing to worry about, and if 9...Be6 10.Be3. Sometimes Black can look to play ...f4 as a sacrifice to open lines, but for it to be effective he normally needs to be able to follow up with one or more of ...Qh4, ...Nh5 and ...Bh3. Here he isn’t ready and 10...f4? (even 10...Qd7 11.Qd2 f4? 12.gxf4 Bh3 13.f3 keeps everything secure and White a pawn to the good) 11.gxf4 exf4? 12.Ndxf4 would just be horrendous for Black, and if 12...Bf7 13.d4! Bxc4 14.d5 followed by Ne6. }
9. h3 $5
{ An interesting moment. White often avoids the exchange on e2 with 9.f3, which is far from bad, but does leave him committed to an f4 approach to give the bishop on g2 some action. }
9... Be6
{ 9...Bxe2 does increase Black’s control over d4, but here White should not be too concerned as he has 10.Nxe2. With Black no longer having a light-squared bishop, there’s no real need for White to fear a kingside attack (that fine bishop on g2 will hold everything together), and 10...f5 (10...Nd4?! 11.Nxd4 exd4 leaves White facing a tempting dilemma: to push the f-pawn or first go 12.b4!?; this seizes space while playing around the pawn on d4, and White has by no means renounced the idea of also going f4-f5) 11.Be3 Qd7 12.Qd2 leaves White pleasantly better. He might expand with Rab1 and b4; another good plan is Rae1 and f4. Just one word of warning: it’s usually a good idea to first move the rook from a1 before pushing b4 – 12...Rae8 13.b4? f4! would not be wise, forcing White to jettison the exchange with 14.gxf4 exf4 15.Bxf4 Bxa1 16.Rxa1. }

{ This calm move is a common one in the Botvinnik, keeping everything secure on the kingside. }

12... f5
{ Naturally Black doesn’t fall for 12...Bxh6?? 13.Nf6+ and 14.Nxd7, while White would be slightly for choice after 12...Nxd5 13.Bxg7 Ne3 (or 13...Nc3 14.Qd2 Kxg7 15.Qxc3 followed by f4) 14.fxe3 Kxg7 15.Rc1. Next up will be the d4 break and if 15...f5 16.exf5 Bxf5 (16...gxf5?! 17.d4 leaves Black under pressure) 17.Qd2 Be6 18.b4 when again White’s bishop is the more active of the two and he has an edge; b5 then Nc3-d5 or even Nc3-e4 will follow. }
13. Bxg7 Kxg7 14. f4
{ Taking the fight to Black and hoping to show that the king on g7 is much less secure than the one on g2, but there was again nothing wrong with 14.Qd2, and if 14...f4? 15.gxf4 Nd4 16.fxe5 dxe5 17.Nxd4 exd4 18.Qg5 with an extra pawn and all the trumps. }
14... Nd4 15. Nxd4 $1

Qd2 Ng8 17. Qf2
{ Forcing Black to advance his c-pawn two squares, but actually 17.Rfe1 c6? was nothing to worry about. The main point is 18.Qf2! cxd5 (even 18...c5 19.e5 is quite strong) 19.Qxd4+ Kh6 (19...Nf6 20.cxd5 Bg8 21.e5 regains the piece with some advantage in view of 21...dxe5 22.fxe5 Nxd5?? 23.e6+) 20.cxd5 Bf7 21.e5, with a crushing position and far too much play for the piece. }
17... c5 18. Rae1
{ Not forgetting to involve all the pieces. Here Black isn’t, of course, about to get rolled over by f4-f5, but his position is still the harder to handle. He can’t easily break out and free his pieces, and all the while must watch out for White making a timely exf5 exchange. }
18... Bxd5
{ A big decision. You can’t blame Black for wanting to avoid 18...Nf6? 19.e5! dxe5 20.Nxf6 Rxf6 21.Rxe5 when White controls the e-file and has much the more active bishop, but a more dynamic response would have been 18...fxe4!? 19.dxe4 b5, leaving the knight on g8 and developing counterplay. }
19. cxd5 Qc7 $2
{ A strange decision. Black needed to activate his knight with 19...Nf6 when spreading the play with 20.b4!? was Simon’s idea, since 20.e5? would now fail to simply 20...dxe5 21.fxe5 Nxd5. }
20. b4 $1
{ You might have wondered about the bishop on g2, but it is actually extremely well placed here and more powerful than Black’s knight. Note how the bishop defends e4 and also indirectly d5, thereby supporting White’s central play, as well as that White now has the definite positional threat of bxc5 dxc5; e5 when his pawns make for a very strong sight. }
20... b6
{ 20...cxb4? 21.Qxd4+ would, of course, not be wise and 20...Nf6? 21.bxc5 dxc5 22.e5 would just allow White his dream scenario. }
21. Re2 $6
{ A little routine. 21.exf5! gxf5 22.Re6 would have been much more dynamic and again made good use of the long-range support offered by White’s bishop. }
21... Rf7 22. Rfe1 Rfe7 $2
{ Now it’s Black’s turn to be too routine, but these positions laden with tension are never easy to defend. 22...fxe4! 23.Rxe4! (23.dxe4 Nf6 is just very messy; whose pawns are going to prove the stronger?) 23...Rxe4 (23...Rfe7 24.g4! begins to put White’s kingside majority to good use) 24.dxe4 would have left White slightly for choice (moving the queen in preparation for e5 is the plan), but still with everything to play for. }
23. bxc5 bxc5
{ Now a young Simon couldn’t resist 24.g4!?, but 24.exf5! was the way to go: 24...Rxe2 (24...gxf5?! 25.Re6! is again a bit awkward for Black, and if 25...Rxe6 26.dxe6 Ne7? 27.g4! when it’s White whose pawns are rolling, dangerously at that, and he most certainly also enjoys the safer king) 25.Rxe2 Rxe2 26.Qxe2 gxf5 27.Qe6 Nh6 (how else to defend f5?) 28.g4! fxg4 29.hxg4. Matters aren’t totally clear, but White’s more mobile pawns and safer king still leave him for choice and he might even meet 29...Qf7 with the calm 30.Kg3. }

1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. g3 Bb4
{ A fairly popular choice, as Black heads for a reversed Rossolimo Sicilian. }
4. e4 $5
{ This immediate advance has been a recent favourite of the world champion’s. }
4... O-O
{ The previous day of the same match had seen Aronian prefer 4...Bxc3 5.dxc3 (there’s also nothing too much wrong with 5.bxc3 d6 6.d3 followed by Bg2 and Nge2) 5...d6 (5...Nxe4 6.Qg4 regains the pawn) 6.f3!? (not our standard development, but after 6.Bg2 0-0 7.Ne2 Be6 8.b3 a5 Black has easy counterplay) 6...Be6 7.Nh3 (very creative play from the world champion; it’s worth noting that White can manoeuvre so because the centre is closed and the structure largely fixed) 7...a5 8.a4 0-0 9.b3 Na6. This was Carlsen-Aronian, Game 5, Clutch Chess (rapid) 2020, where Black had a handy lead in development, but was struggling to do much with it due to his current lack of a pawn break. Magnus continued in creative and ambitious fashion: 10.Ng5 (10.Be3 h6 11.Nf2 would be sensible when after 11...Nd7! 12.Bg2 f5 13.exf5 Bxf5 14.0-0 the chances are about level in a very rich and unbalanced position, where White should be looking to break with f4) 10...Bd7 11.Be3 Nc5 12.Ra2!? and now 12...Qc8 13.Rd2 h6 14.h4! would have been extremely unclear. In a fast game it wouldn’t be at all easy to work out how to free Black’s position and, of course, he must avoid 14...hxg5?? 15.hxg5 Nh7 on account of the simple and deadly 16.Rdh2. When did you last see two rooks doubled so quickly on an open h-file? }
5. Nge2 d6
{ Magnus first unveiled 4.e4!? in the first game of his rapid play-off with Fabiano Caruana at the end of their world championship match in London. Fabiano went for immediate counterplay with 5...c6 6.Bg2 a6 7.0-0 b5, but after 8.d4! White’s central pressure was the main feature of the position. Now 8...d6 9.a3 Bxc3 10.Nxc3 bxc4?! 11.dxe5 dxe5 did leave Black a pawn ahead, but with a queenside riddled with holes. Here one simple route to a very pleasant advantage is 12.Qe2!? (Magnus preferred 12.Na4 Be6 13.Qxd8 Rxd8 14.Be3 Nbd7 15.f3 and went on to secure a very important victory) 12...a5 (12...Qd3 13.Qxd3 cxd3 14.Rd1 Rd8 15.Na4! is quite awkward for Black; just look at those holes and note that 15...Be6 16.Nc5 Bc4? fails to 17.b3 Bb5? 18.a4) 13.Rd1 Qe7 14.Be3 Be6 15.h3 Nbd7 16.f4. Black has managed to cling on to his extra c-pawn, but f5 is a large threat and one not so easy to meet. Indeed, even 16...exf4 (or 16...g6 17.f5!? gxf5 18.exf5 Bxf5 19.Qxc4 when Black has weaknesses right across the board) 17.gxf4 Rfe8 18.Qf2! is quite awkward for him, and if 18...Bf5 19.e5. It’s rare that White gets to take over the centre so, but our favourite e4 and f4 Botvinnik pawns really can pack a powerful punch at many times, and here do also enjoy the sight of those two powerful bishops on e3 and g2! }
6. h3
{ Prophylaxis against ...Bg4. White simply wants to get his king to safety on the kingside and then expand with the f4 break. }
6... Nc6 7. Bg2 a6
{ One point of White’s move order is that he can, of course, recapture after 7...Bxc3 with the knight, but 8.bxc3!? is also quite tempting, especially if it leads to 8...Be6 (8...a6!? is a better try, but White does have 9.a4 followed by d3, 0-0 and f4) 9.d3 Qd7? 10.f4!. Once again we see Black with a lead in development, but also under heavy pressure already, with his bishop proving something of a target on e6. Now 10...Qe7 11.f5 Bd7 12.g4! would just be a dream and free attack for White. }
8. O-O b5 9. d3
{ Keeping control rather than allow Black far too much activity for a pawn with 9.cxb5 axb5 10.Nxb5? Ba6 11.Nbc3 Bd3. }
9... bxc4 10. dxc4 Bc5 $1
{ Black reroutes his bishop to a more active diagonal, but he won’t be able to tactically prevent f4 for ever. }
11. Kh2
{ Freeing the f-pawn for action, but it’s important not to rush with f4 here. }
11... Rb8 12. b3 $1
{ Magnus wants to retain control of the position, not rush into 12.f4 exf4 13.gxf4, which just feels very unclear. He may also have been concerned about the possibility of 13...Ng4+?, which is a tactical motif we advise you to file away and never allow – in a strong guise! Here White can, though, defend with 14.hxg4 Qh4+ 15.Bh3 Bxg4 16.Qd3! when Black shouldn’t have enough for his piece with Qg3 next up. }
12... a5 13. Nd5
{ It’s time to apply a spot of pressure and central play is, of course, very justified in response to Black’s queenside attack. 13.Bb2 Be6 14.Na4!? was also possible, though, and if 14...Ba7 15.f4. This position isn’t so easy to assess, but we must admit that we quite like White. After f5 followed by g4 Black may simply find himself in huge danger on the kingside before he’s obtained too much on the queenside. }
13... a4 14. Be3 $5
{ Naturally Magnus doesn’t fall for 14.Bg5?? Ng4+ 15.hxg4 Qxg5 when 16.f3 h5! would be horrific for White, but as well as the creative text, 14.Bb2 was very much an option, getting ready to go f4, which will place e5 and f6 under some pressure. }
14... axb3 15. axb3 Bxe3
{ It was also possible to retain the tension, but Aronian presumably didn’t fear any half-open f-file. }
16. fxe3 $1
{ A dynamic and important recapture, in contrast to 16.Nxe3 Nd7 17.f4 Nc5 when Black certainly obtains some counterplay. }
16... Nd7
{ Avoiding any structure-shattering exchange on f6, but 16...Nxd5!? 17.exd5 Ne7 was also possible and would have been pretty unclear. White might now go 18.Qd3, intending Qc3, b4 and c5, aiming to make use of his queenside majority. }
17. Nec3
{ Magnus must have been fairly happy at this point. His clever recapture has bought White control of d4 and while Black may not be worse, his position is the harder to play due to his ongoing slight cramp. }
17... Nc5
{ Even here Black probably should have tried 17...Nb6 18.Nb5 Nxd5 19.exd5 Ne7. }
18. Nb5 $1 { Seizing the initiative. } 18... Ne6 19. h4
{ Carlsen’s play in this game reminds us of Tigran Petrosian. Not only does White prepare to activate his bishop on h3, but he also gains space, all the while as he continues to restrict Black in true Petrosianic boa constrictor style. }
19... Bd7 20. Bh3 Rb7 $6
{ 20...Nc5! really needed to be tried, giving up c7, but counterattacking against e4. }
21. b4 $1
{ This would have been strong too on the previous move. Now there is no ...Nc5 and Black is fast becoming very passive. }
21... Ne7 22. Ra2
{ White hints at switching the rook to the kingside and under some pressure, Aronian now cracks. }
22... Nc8 $2
{ Did you spot why the b-pawn wasn’t hanging? 22...Bxb5 23.cxb5 Rxb5 certainly feels rather risky for Black and it actually loses: 24.Bxe6! fxe6 25.Rxf8+ Qxf8 (or 25...Kxf8 26.Qf1+ Kg8 27.Nxe7+ Qxe7 28.Qxb5) 26.Nxe7+ Qxe7 27.Ra8+ Kf7 28.Qh5+ Kf6 29.g4! and White’s attack is very much a mating one. }
23. Ra8 $1
{ A powerful pin and one which makes Black even more tied down than he already was. }
23... Kh8
{ As good a try as anything. This time 23...Bxb5? 24.cxb5 Rxb5? would have failed to 25.Bxe6 fxe6 26.Rxf8+ followed by Qf1+ or 26...Qxf8 27.Rxc8! Qxc8 28.Ne7+ and goodnight, Vienna! }
24. Qh5
{ With total control over the position, Magnus goes for the throat. 24.Qa1 was also extremely strong, intending to invade with Qa6. }
24... Qe8 25. Bf5
{ Winning, as would have been 25.Nf6! gxf6 26.Bf5. Black can cling on for now with 26...Ng5, but after 27.hxg5 Bxf5 28.exf5 Rg8 29.gxf6 his kingside would not have remained intact for long. }
25... h6 26. Bh3 $1
{ Highly aesthetic play as the bishop returns, thereby clearing the f-file for action. }
26... c6
{ 26...Bxb5 27.Rf6! reveals White’s deadly threat: 27...Kh7 (if 27...gxf6? 28.Qxh6+ Kg8 29.Nxf6 mate) 28.Rxc8! Qxc8 29.Bf5+ and mate is forced, as if 29...Kg8 30.Ne7+ Kh8 31.Rxh6+ gxh6 32.Qxh6 mate. Black could have prevented the threat with 26...f6, but after 27.Qxe8 Rxe8 28.Bxe6 Rxe6 29.Nbxc7 his position collapses nonetheless. }
27. Nxd6 $1
{ Winning the queen, but there was absolutely nothing wrong either with 27.Rf6!. }
27... Nxd6 28. Rxe8 Rxe8 29. Nf6 $1 { Carlsen is merciless. } 29... Re7
{ 29...gxf6 30.Rxf6 would be a devastating attack, as we can see from 30...Kg7 31.Rxh6 Rxb4 32.Bxe6 Rxe6 (32...Rb2+ 33.Kg1 Rb1+ 34.Kg2 Rb2+ 35.Kf3 dodges the checks) 33.Qg5+ Rg6 34.Qxe5+! f6 (if 34...Kxh6 35.Qh8 mate) 35.Rxg6+ Kxg6 36.Qxd6 with too much extra material. }
30. c5 Nc4 31. Nxd7 Rbxd7 32. Rxf7 $1 { The final blow. } 32... Rxf7 33. Bxe6
Rf2+ 34. Kh3
{ Black is completely gone on the light squares and losing his knight for starters. }

1. c4 g6
{ It would have been wrong not to feature a game by the man who did so much to put the Botvinnik English on the map, Mikhail Botvinnik. Another game by the fifth world champion saw him attacking in true Botvinnik English fashion: 1...Nf6 2.Nc3 g6 3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 0-0 5.e4 d6 6.Nge2 e5 7.0-0 Nbd7 8.d3 Nc5 (Black’s set-up isn’t the best and White can already seize the initiative) 9.f4! c6 10.h3 Ne6 11.f5! Nd4 12.g4 Ne8 13.Be3 (having driven a wedge right into the black kingside, Botvinnik completes his development ahead of pressing ahead against the black king) 13...a6 14.Qd2 b5 15.Bg5!? (15.Ng3 Rb8 16.g5 would also have been strong, and if 16...f6 17.h4!) 15...Bf6? (15...f6 was necessary, if grim for Black after 16.Be3 c5 17.Ng3 when White is in complete control) 16.Bxf6 Nxf6 17.Nxd4! exd4 18.Ne2 Qb6. This defends the dead point on d4, but now Black is simply swept aside on the kingside: 19.cxb5 axb5 20.Qh6! Bd7 21.g5 Nh5 22.Nf4 Ng7 23.f6! 1-0. Rarely did games in the legendary Soviet Championship finish as fast as Botvinnik-V.Shcherbakov, Moscow 1955, where Black gave up in view of 23...Ne8 24.Nxg6! (even the slow-motion 24.h4 is pretty effective) 24...fxg6 (or 24...hxg6 25.Rf4 and Rh4) 25.f7+! Rxf7 26.Rxf7 Kxf7 27.Qxh7+ Ke6 28.Rf1 and the black king clearly isn’t long for this world. }
2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 e5 4. Nc3
{ All very normal so far, but now Black springs a small surprise. } 4... Ne7 $5
{ Unusual, but not bad. The key as White in such lines, which we’ll see more of in Chapter Four, is not to worry and to trust in our Botvinnik set-up. }
5. d3 c6 6. e4 { Here we go... } 6... d6
{ You might wonder about 6...d5?! 7.exd5 cxd5 8.cxd5 0-0, which isn’t totally dissimilar to a line of the Panov-Botvinnik (yes, the Patriarch again!) Caro-Kann. Our English bishop does a great job of overprotecting d5 and after 9.Nge2 Nd7 (or 9...Na6 10.0-0 Nc7 11.Qb3) 10.0-0 Nf6 11.Bg5 White is a pawn to the good, and ready to obtain some play of his own after Qb3 and Rac1. }
7. Nge2 a6 8. a4
{ A big decision, ruling out ...b5 once and for all, but weakening White’s dark squares on the queenside. We can’t help wondering if Magnus wouldn’t have calmly castled here and after 8.0-0!? b5 White might simply retain control with 9.a3, intending Be3 and maybe then Qd2 and f4. }
8... a5 9. Be3 Be6 10. O-O Qd7
{ 10...Na6 might seem more consistent, but does also allow White a fairly pleasant choice between 11.f4 and 11.b3!?, switching to a d4 break. We should also mention 10...d5?, which still loses a pawn, on account of 11.exd5! cxd5 12.Bc5! when Black’s position is creaking badly in view of 12...dxc4 13.Bxb7. }
11. b3 $1 { Botvinnik wants to hit back in the centre with d4. } 11... h5 $5
{ Black certainly didn’t want to complete development with 11...0-0 12.d4 Na6 in this game. As well as the text, an attacking try is 11...Bh3 12.d4 h5, but here White has at least 13.dxe5 (13.Bxh3 Qxh3 14.f3! is another important method of keeping everything under control at the back and here Black’s queen would be trapped after 14...h4 15.g4 and Kh1) 13...dxe5 14.Qxd7+ Bxd7 15.h3, with a pleasant edge and Black set to come under pressure after Rad1 and f4. }
12. h4 $1 { A good decision, keeping lines closed. } 12... Bh3
{ 12...c5!? would have prevented White’s next, but not stopped him from standing well after 13.Nd5!. Then Nec3 and Nb5 might be possible, as could be Bg5 to increase the pressure, and all the while at some point, White will arrange to break with f4. }
13. d4 O-O 14. Ra2 $1
{ A sophisticated and strong move. The rook will be ideally placed in front of the queen on the d-file as Botvinnik wants more than the edge 14.dxe5 Bxg2 15.Kxg2 dxe5 16.Qxd7 Nxd7 17.Rfd1 would have given him. }
14... Bxg2 15. Kxg2 d5 $2
{ White had ensured that even here this was a premature break. With 15...Qe6 Black would tempt White to close the centre, but 16.Rd2! remains strong. You might be concerned by 16...f5, but the king on g2 is quite safe so long as White doesn’t allow a strong ...f4 breakthrough. Don’t forget that White is much the better developed and coordinated, and after the calm 17.dxe5! dxe5 18.exf5 gxf5 (or 18...Nxf5 19.Bc5 Re8 20.Ne4 with complete control and plenty of holes to eye in the black camp) 19.Bg5! Black simply comes under heavy pressure and would get nowhere with 19...f4 20.gxf4 Nf5 (if 20...exf4 21.Nxf4) 21.Re1 – opening lines has only played into the hands of White’s much better developed forces. The other way to release the tension was 15...exd4 16.Bxd4, but this also looks very nice for White with Rd2 and perhaps even f4 on the way. }
16. dxe5 dxc4
{ Black also lands up with far too many weak squares after 16...dxe4 17.Nxe4 Bxe5 18.Rd2 Qf5 19.Qb1!. }
17. bxc4 $1
{ 17.Rd2 Qe6 18.f4!? would have tempted both of us, but unsurprisingly Botvinnik wants to maintain control. }
17... Bxe5 18. Qxd7 Nxd7 19. Rd2
{ Simple chess has left White clearly for choice. He might have an extra pawn island, but what matters most is the half-open b-file and that weakness on b7. }
19... Bxc3
{ An attempt to distract White rather than just meekly lose a pawn with 19...Nf6 20.Rb1 Rfb8 when 21.Bc5 is likely even stronger than doubling the rooks. }
20. Rxd7 $1
{ Botvinnik is having nothing to do with the bishop, not wanting to allow Black to dig in for the defence as he would have done with 20.Nxc3 Ne5 21.Bc5 Rfe8. }
20... Bb4 { The only way to save both pieces, as if 20...Bf6? 21.e5!. } 21. c5
{ Cutting off the black bishop from the game. } 21... Rfe8 22. Rfd1 $1
{ Botvinnik first takes control of the file, thereby not allowing Black even a smidgen of counterplay with 22.Rxb7 Rad8. }
22... f5
{ Desperation, but if 22...Rab8 23.Rc7 when Black can no longer challenge the file and Rdd7 is on its way. }
23. Rxb7 fxe4 24. Rd6
{ It’s high time to invade Black’s weakness-laden position. } 24... Kf7 25. Nf4
Reb8 26. Rbd7 { Keeping full control while renewing the threat of Nxg6. } 26...
Ke8 27. Ne6
{ Black gave up and no wonder in view of his complete lack of freedom and such lines as 27...Nd5 (or 27...Nf5 28.Nc7+ Kf8 29.Rf6+) 28.Nc7+ Nxc7 29.Rxc7 Rc8 30.Rh7 when the computer unsurprisingly announces mate in eight. }

1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e6
{ While our focus is very much on the Botvinnik set-up, Black can wrong-foot us with an early ...e6 or ...c6, preparing a quick ...d5 counter. In such cases we advocate White seizes the bull by the horns, grabbing space with e4. }
3. e4 $1
{ The Mikenas Attack. Note too that 3.g3?! d5 would merely leave our knight on c3 misplaced. }
3... d5
{ As we will see, a very important alternative is 3...c5, but at club level, Black is often caught out by White’s boldness. When that happens, 3...d6?! is sometimes seen. This does prevent e5, but allows White a pleasant choice between seizing space with 4.d4 and going for a Botvinnik set-up after all with 4.g3. }
4. e5 d4
{ Black decides to grab some space of his own, and exchanges now follow. } 5.
exf6 dxc3 6. bxc3 Qxf6 7. d4
{ Taking stock, White should be quite happy. He does have doubled pawns, but also good central control, as well as the easier development, with Black’s queen a definite target. }
7... e5
{ Freeing his position, but Black must be careful not to fall too far behind in development. }
8. Nf3 exd4 9. Bg5 $1
{ Much stronger than allowing Black to speed up his development with 9.cxd4 Bb4+. }
9... Qe6+ 10. Be2
{ Already all the minor pieces are developed, in contrast to Black’s, and there is a clear tactical reason why Black can’t capture on c3. }
10... f6 $6
{ A rather greedy and weakening move, if one recommended by old theory. Note that White doesn’t have to capture after 10...d3?!, but can go 11.0-0! and after 11...Bc5 (and not 11...dxe2? 12.Qd8 mate or 11...Qxe2? 12.Re1) 12.Bxd3 0-0 13.Re1 Qa6 14.Nd4!, preparing Qh5, English Opening guru Tony Kosten already enjoyed a powerful initiative and some advantage in Kosten-Gregoire, Cap d’Agde 2003. Instead of weakening, Black might develop with 10...Be7 when 11.Bxe7 d3 (11...Qxe7 12.cxd4 0-0 13.0-0 Bg4 14.Rb1 b6 15.Re1 also gave the teenage Simon a pleasant edge in Williams-Stummer, Budapest 1994) 12.0-0 Qxe7 (12...Qxe2? no longer costs Black his queen, but is well met by 13.Qb1! followed by Re1 or 13...Qxe7 14.Re1 Be6 15.Qxb7, bagging a clear exchange) 13.Bxd3 0-0 14.Re1 Qf6 was the course of Williams-Matthiesen, Aarhus 1998. White’s queenside pawns aren’t the prettiest, but he has a handy lead in development and 15.Be4! disrupts Black’s queenside development, with 15...c6 (15...Qxc3 16.Qb1 h6 17.Bxb7 regains the pawn with advantage) 16.Qd4 a sensible way of putting White’s more active pieces to good use. }
11. Nxd4 Qf7 12. Bh6 $3
{ A very enjoyable move to play. Simon can still remember the excitement he felt when first shown the idea by his dad, Doug. Even in the pre-engine era it wasn’t too hard to appreciate the strength of this blow, which overturned theory’s assessment of ‘playable for Black’. Amazingly only in 2004 did the idea make it into Chess Informant, and in Informant 91 Shariyazdanov won an award for the novelty...even though it had been first played by Simon some nine years earlier! }
12... g6
{ GM James Howell (not to be confused with leading current English GM David Howell) was unlikely to fall for 12...Nd7? 13.Bxg7! Qxg7 (13...Bxg7 14.Bh5 pins and wins) 14.Bh5+ when Black loses his queen to a fork wherever he moves his king. It’s by no means impossible, though, that Black would allow such a blow at club level, although there he would surely spot 12...gxh6?? 13.Bh5. The text move isn’t forced, but 12...Be7 13.Bh5 g6 14.Be2 is also unpleasant for Black, who is unable to castle and behind in development. }
13. Bxf8
{ Simple and strong, although to be fair so is Shariyazdanov’s 13.Qd2 Bxh6 14.Qxh6 Na6 15.0-0. }
13... Kxf8
{ 13...Qxf8 would preserve castling rights, but after 14.0-0 Qc5 15.Re1 0-0 16.Bf3!? White has a dream position: holes, especially on e6, to aim at and the possibility of swinging the queen into an attack via d2 and h6, not least in the event of the greedy 16...Qxc4 17.Re7. }
14. h4 $1 { Even in 1995 Simon very much understood the importance of Harry. }
14... h5
{ Prudently blocking, albeit at the cost of further weaknesses, rather than fall victim to a deadly attack with 14...Kg7? 15.h5 Re8 16.hxg6 hxg6 17.Qd2. }
15. O-O Kg7 16. Bf3 $5
{ Again we see this idea. Simon actually couldn’t help himself here and 16.f4?! Nc6 (16...c5!? 17.Nb5 Nc6 also restricts White to an edge) 17.Nxc6 bxc6 18.Qa4 was only a little better for him in the game. That said, impressively Simon ground out the win, and against the author of the excellent Essential Chess Endings no less, to help him obtain his first IM norm: 18...Qe7?! 19.Bf3?! (White can get away with 19.Qxc6!, as if 19...Bd7 20.Qxc7 Rhc8 21.Qb7) 19...Qc5+ 20.Kh1 Rb8 21.Qxc6 Qxc6 22.Bxc6 Rd8 23.Rfe1 Kf8 24.Rab1 Rb6?! 25.Be4! Bf5 26.Bxf5 gxf5 27.Rxb6?

(allowing his most important piece in the endgame to be cut off; Black had to be prepared to lose his h-pawn with 30...Ke6!) 31.Rxa7 Rxc3 32.Ra4 Rc1+ 33.Kh2 Rc3 34.Rb4 Ra3 35.Rxb6 Ra4 36.Rc6 Rxa2 37.Rc8 Rc2 38.c5 Rc3 39.c6 (39.Rc7! decisively paralyses the black king, after which White will simply walk his king round to help shepherd the c-pawn home) 39...Kg7? (time-trouble; Black had to try 39...Kf7, as the standard trick 40.c7 Ke7 41.Rh8 isn’t winning in this position) 40.c7! Kh7 (now 40...Kf7 41.Rh8 would, of course, be all over) 41.Kg1 Rc2 42.Kf1 Kg7 43.Ke1 (here comes the king; f5 is the target) 43...Rc6 44.Kd2 Rc4 45.Kd3 Rc1 46.Kd4 Rc2 47.Kd5 Rc1 48.Ke6 Re1+ 49.Kxf5 Rc1 50.g4! hxg4 (or 50...Rc5+ 51.Ke6 hxg4 52.Kd6) 51.Kxg4 Rc5 52.h5 Kh7 53.h6 1-0. Returning to 16.Bf3!?: }
16... c6
{ It’s not so easy for Black to complete his development, as we can see from 16...Nd7? 17.Bd5 and 16...Qxc4? 17.Re1 when White has far too much for the pawn, as shown by 17...Rf8 (17...Qf7 is a better defence, but still very promising for White after 18.Qd2 followed by simply doubling the rooks or 18...Re8 19.Bd5! Rxe1+ 20.Rxe1 Qxd5 21.Re7+ Kf8 22.Rh7 with a crushing attack) 18.Bxb7! Bxb7 19.Re7+ Rf7 (19...Kg8 20.Qb1 f5 21.Qxb7 is equally hopeless) 20.Ne6+ Kh6 (20...Kg8 21.Qd8+ leads to mate) 21.Qd2+ g5 22.hxg5+ Kg6 23.gxf6 when the huge threat of Qg5+ leaves Black not long for this world. }
17. Re1 Na6 $2
{ This allows a tactical blow, but finding an improvement is by no means easy for Black. }
18. Nxc6 $1 bxc6 $2
{ Black should probably prefer to suffer a pawn down after 18...Be6 19.Na5 Rad8 20.Qe2. }
19. Qd6 $1 Re8 20. Rxe8 Qxe8 21. Bxc6
{ These moves should all be commonplace by now and soon you’ll be used to the following fairly common sequence. }
21... f5
{ Don’t forget about the f4-square in this and all lines where Black has a pawn on f5. Indeed, 9.h3? (thematic, but there’s good reason why we advocate 9.exf5) 9...f4! 10.gxf4 Nh5 is just quite a strong version of the typical pawn sacrifice for Black, largely due to that slow and weakening h3 move. Richard was even once able to catch Simon out with this line, although after 11.f5! (playing to close the position; 11.fxe5? dxe5 12.Nd5 might even be met by 12...Qh4, and if 13.Kh2? Nd4 – and ouch! Black threatens to invade on f3 and 14.Nxd4 exd4 15.f4 fails to simply 15...c6 16.Nb4 Nxf4 with too strong an attack on the dark squares) 11...gxf5 (11...Qh4!? was also very tempting) 12.exf5 Qh4 13.Ng3... ...he failed to find 13...Rxf5! (13...Nf4? 14.Qg4 Qxg4 15.hxg4 Nxd3 16.Nd5 left the boot very much on the other foot and Black soon gave up in Williams-Palliser, 4NCL 2002) 14.Nxf5 Bxf5 15.Kh2 Nd4 with an extremely strong attack for Black. The move h3 is often an integral part of White’s set-up, usefully taking control of the g4-square and so preventing Be3 being met by ...Ng4, for instance, but do beware playing h3 too early when Black has gone for an early ...f5. }

Rae1 f5 12. Bg5
{ Getting out of the way of Black’s f-pawn. Please don’t forget about the significant dangers of 12.h3?? f4! 13.gxf4 Bxh3!, but the other standard idea, 12.exf5 gxf5 13.f4, would be far from terrible were you to forget your theory. }
12... Nxe2+ 13. Rxe2 Qc7 14. exf5 $1
{ White finally goes in for the thematic exchange, after which much of the play will centre around his key pawn breaks, d4 and f4. }
14... Bxf5
{ 14...gxf5!? may improve, as we saw before, but then White has the thematic 15.f4. }
15. h3
{ With a certain threat and rarely an unhelpful move to insert, apart from when it allows ...f4 with force, which isn’t, of course, the case here. }
15... Be6 16. b3
{ Useful preparation for the eventual d4. Note too Black’s lack of counterplay. }
16... Rae8
{ Clearly Black can’t bring a rook to the d-file or kick the bishop on g5. He might try to get around those issues with 16...Nf6, but then White can beat him to it and break first: 17.d4! exd4 (17...Rad8 18.Rfe1 merely ramps up the pressure down the e-file) 18.Qxd4 Bf5 (18...Nd5 fails to simply 19.Nxd5, and if 19...Bxd4?? 20.Nxc7) and now 19.Qd2! is a prudent retreat. What’s this, isn’t White losing time? Yes, you can ask, but it was wise to escape from the gaze of the bishop on g7. This way White also prevents ...h6, all the while maintaining a very pleasant advantage: for example, 19...Rae8 (or 19...Rad8 20.Rfe1 Rf7 21.g4 Bc8 22.Ne4 Nxe4 23.Rxe4 Rdf8 24.Be7 and something is going to give) 20.Rxe8 Rxe8 21.g4 Bc8 22.Rd1 when the weakness of d6 is the main feature of the position and even 22...Qa5 fails to really help Black in view of 23.Bxf6! Bxf6 24.Ne4. }
17. Rfe1 Qd7 18. Kh2
{ Yet another useful move as Kamsky is content to gradually strength his position. }
18... Rf7
{ The American legend may have been hoping Black would grow impatient and break with 18...d5?! when 19.Bh6! maintains control. Black can try to throw a spanner into the works, but 19...Nf4!? (19...dxc4? 20.dxc4 Qxd2 21.Bxd2 merely leaves White in complete control, while 19...d4 20.Ne4 b6 21.Bxg7 Kxg7 22.Ng5 would begin to probe with menace against e5 and on the light squares) 20.Bxg7 Bxh3 (20...Nxg2 21.Bxf8 Nxe1 22.Qxe1 Rxf8 23.Rxe5 Bxh3 24.Re7 also turns out rather well for White) 21.gxf4! Bxg2 doesn’t force perpetual check. Yes, this line has suddenly become quite sharp, but it’s important not to panic in such situations, not least when you’re material up in the capturing sequence. Rather than capture on g2 and allow the draw, White can throw his own spanner in the works with 22.f5! and after 22...Rxf5 (22...Qxf5 23.Qh6! is a second very handy resource; it’s not only Black who can attack, and after 23...Rf7 24.Rxe5 Rxe5 25.Rxe5 Qxf2 26.Re8+ White wins) 23.Kxg2 Kxg7 24.Rh1 Black shouldn’t have enough for his piece. }
19. Ne4 $1 { A strong manoeuvre, heading for g5 or even c5 if allowed. } 19...
b6 20. Bh6 Rff8
{ Calm defence and it was actually very easy for Black to lose quickly around here, as might well have been the case after 20...d5? 21.Bxg7 Kxg7 22.Ng5 Rfe7 23.Rxe5. }
21. Bxg7 Nxg7 22. d4 $1
{ Essential before ...Nf5 arrived, but by beating Black to the central advance, White has confirmed his clear superiority. }
22... d5 { 22...exd4? 23.Qxd4 Nf5 does defend d6, but also allows 24.Nf6+. }
23. cxd5 cxd5 24. Ng5 e4
{ A fairly forced move, seeing that Black’s position would quickly collapse in the centre after 24...exd4 25.Qxd4. }
25. f3 $1
{ Naturally White must break so, otherwise his bishop on g2 and rooks would but look most misplaced. }
25... exf3 26. Nxf3 Qd6 27. Ng5
{ Back again as there’s no doubt that White retains complete control. } 27...
Bd7 28. Re5 { The pressure continues to mount. } 28... Bc6 29. h4 $1
{ It’s high time to involve Harry, if more on positional grounds than as part of a direct attack. Kamsky has in mind a further strong knight manoeuvre. }
29... h6 30. Nh3 $1 Kh7 31. Nf4 Rf5 32. Rxe8
{ This can hardly be bad, but White might have overprotected e5 with his queen or even gone 32.h5!?, and if 32...g5 (or 32...Rfxe5 33.hxg6+ Kg8 34.dxe5 Rxe5 35.Rxe5 Qxe5 36.Qc2! Qd6 37.Qd3, retaining complete control ahead of picking off d5) 33.Qc2 gxf4 34.g4, winning the exchange. }

Rf6 34. Re5 Bf7 35. Bg4 Qd8 36. Qe3 Rc6
{ Finally Black has a smidgen of play, but White’s central and kingside play is much more important than anything down the c-file. }
37. Re7
{ 37.Be2! would have been fairly strong, followed by Bd3 or 37...Rc2 38.Qd3 Rxa2 39.h5 Qf6 40.Kh3!? when Black is completely tied down and Bf3 and Bxd5 will follow. }
37... Rc7 38. Rxc7 Qxc7 39. Qd3 Qe7 40. h5
{ Once again, not failing to make good use of Harry. } 40... Qg5 41. Kh3 Nf5
{ Black finally tires of waiting. After 41...Qf6 White might even seize some further space with 42.b4. }
42. Bxf5 $1 { Naturally White wants to maintain full control. } 42... gxf5
{ Black has no desire to be forced into extreme passivity after 42...Qxf5+ 43.Qxf5 gxf5 44.g4! (never forget to activate the most important piece in the endgame, the king!) 44...fxg4+ 45.Kxg4 Kg7 46.Kf5. }
43. Qe2 Kg8 44. Kg2

{ Presumably Kamsky was concerned by 48.Qxb6 Qd1, but here White has at least 49.Qc7!? when it’s his attack which will quickly be a decisive one after 49...Qd2+ 50.Kh3 Qxa2? 51.Nh5+, and if 51...Kg6 52.Qe5! Kxh5 53.Qxf5 mate. }
48... Kg8 49. Qe5 Qd1 $1

{ The leading Paraguayan Grandmaster wastes no time going for our favourite set-up. }
6... Nc6 7. O-O e5 8. d3 Nh5
{ Once again we see a strong black player and noted theoretician, the Swedish GM Emanuel Berg, quickly freeing his f-pawn for duty and the standard King’s Indian counterplay. }
9. Be3 f5 10. exf5 $1 { Refusing to allow Black to boss the kingside. } 10...
Bxf5
{ By now we very much hope that it’s become second nature to meet 10...gxf5 with 11.f4. }
11. d4 Qd7
{ After 11...exd4 12.Nxd4 the English bishop on g2 really comes into its own and something like 12...Nxd4 13.Bxd4 c6 14.Bxg7 Nxg7 (and not 14...Kxg7? 15.g4!) 15.Qd2 would leave White in control and the weakness of d6 the main feature of the position. }
12. d5 $1
{ Not closing lines to engage in a typical King’s Indian race between queenside and kingside ambitions, but to retain control and a very pleasant edge. }
12... Ne7 13. f3
{ Another useful move. Richard remembers once being surprised to reach this position twice in a simul, but he certainly wasn’t going to complain when one of the opponents now failed to clock White’s threat: g4. }
13... Bh3 14. Bxh3
{ White has no fear of the black queen on h3, and rightly so. } 14... Qxh3 15.
Ne4 $1
{ This move is why White holds a pleasant advantage. Do observe that despite his two pieces on the h-file, Black actually isn’t threatening anything and his bishop on g7 is hardly the pride and joy of the King’s Indian player. }
15... Qd7
{ A prudent retreat. 15...Nf5? hurls another piece into the fray, but after 16.Bd2 White has g3 securely protected. Not only is g4 a threat, but Nf2, so Black has to go backwards: 16...Ne7 17.g4! Nf4 18.Nxf4 exf4 19.Ng5 Qh6 20.Ne6 with a dream outpost for White. }
16. g4 $1 { Again this advance, and again it’s a strong one. } 16... Nf6 17.
N2c3
{ Maintaining control. 17.Ng5? would be premature and after 17...Bh6 (17...b5!? also exploits White’s lack of control) 18.Qd2? Nxg4! 19.fxg4 Qxg4+ 20.Kh1 Qxc4 Black would enjoy promising play for the piece. }
17... Nxe4 18. Nxe4 h6
{ Black tires of having Ng5 issues hanging over him. He is, though, now even more passive, but 18...c6!? wouldn’t really have helped matters, in view of 19.dxc6 Nxc6 20.Qd5+! Kh8 21.Rad1, retaining complete control ahead of picking off d6. }
19. Qd3
{ Not bad, but here and on the next move we quite like 19.h4!?. Only then will White go Kg2, Rf2, Qd3 and Raf1, all the while having prevented ...g5, thereby keeping Black bottled up, and not fearing 19...h5 20.Rc1 hxg4 21.fxg4 Rxf1+ 22.Kxf1 Rf8+ 23.Kg2 when White remains in full control. }
19... Rf7 20. Kg2
{ A useful tidying move. Perhaps an engine could hold tight and defend Black’s position, but his cause is miserable – and without having made an obvious mistake. Just compare the difference in activity between the two sides’ minor pieces! }
20... Raf8 21. Rf2 g5 22. Kg3 $5
{ A bold move, but Bachmann is quickly rewarded for his bravery. Instead, 22.Ng3 Rf6 was Black’s idea when he has a pawn for the exchange and chances to draw after 23.Qe4 Ng6 24.Nf5 Rxf5! 25.gxf5 Nh4+ 26.Kh1 Nxf5. }
22... Ng6 $2
{ This needed to be prepared with 22...Qe8! when 23.c5 Ng6 24.Raf1 is only slightly better for White – unless Black rushes with 24...Nf4? 25.Bxf4 exf4+ 26.Kg2. Yes, the bishop on g7 is now playing, but what else is in Black’s position? White will double on the e-file and retain control, with queenside pressure and much the safer king. }
23. Nxg5 $1
{ The blow Bachmann’s last move teed up. Berg must have miscalculated something in the upcoming sequence. }
23... e4 24. Qxe4 Be5+ 25. f4 $1 hxg5
{ Possibly Black had missed that he lacks a single decent discovered check after 25...Nxf4? 26.Nxf7. }
26. Qxg6+ Rg7 27. Qe6+ $1 { It’s high time to get the queens off. } 27... Qxe6
28. dxe6 gxf4+ 29. Bxf4 Re7 30. Bxe5 { Simplifying to an easy win. } 30... Rxf2
31. Bxd6 $5 Rxe6 32. Kxf2 Rxd6 33. b3 Rd2+ 34. Kg3
{ Once again we should also consider the move order 4...d6 5.e4 e5 6.Nge2. Here Black normally goes 6...0-0, transposing below, or develops his knight to c6. Rare options are: a) 6...Be6 7.d3 c6 8.0-0 Qd7 (8...d5? is premature, but just the type of bid for freedom which might be seen at club level; unfortunately for Black, 9.exd5 cxd5 10.Qb3 makes full use of our fianchettoed bishop and leaves Black in serious trouble on the long diagonal) 9.b3 (preparation for d4; 9.f4!? is also quite tempting here, and if 9...h5 10.Qd2!?, which is a very sneaky computer idea with the point that 10...h4? 11.f5! gxf5 12.Qg5 wins a piece) 9...h5!? (it still wasn’t too late to castle) 10.h4 (sensibly keeping lines closed) 10...Ng4?! (Black needed to prevent White’s next with 10...c5, when 11.f3 0-0 12.Be3 Nc6 13.Qd2 is only a touch better for White, who will go Bh6 and then look to break with f4) 11.d4! exd4 12.Nxd4 c5 13.Nde2! (and not 13.Nxe6?? Bxc3; always be careful about the long diagonal once you’ve moved the b-pawn!) 13...Nc6 14.Bf4 Nge5 (14...Nd4? 15.Nxd4 Bxd4 won’t plug the d-file for long, and White might even go 16.Nb5!? Bxa1 17.Nxd6+ Kf8 18.Qxa1 with superb play for the exchange on the dark squares) 15.Qd2 Rd8 16.Rad1 left Black low on counterplay and nursing weaknesses down the d-file in I.Thompson-I.Sokolov, Stockholm 2010. b) 6...c6 7.0-0 (there’s nothing wrong with 7.d3, but the text is slightly more flexible; White definitely wants to castle, whereas he may be able to go d4 in one go) 7...Be6 8.b3!? (a different way of handling the position; 8.d3 would take play back into Thompson-Sokolov, above) 8...Qd7 9.d4! 0-0 (one of White’s points is 9...Bh3 10.dxe5 dxe5 11.Qxd7+ Bxd7 12.Ba3, keeping the black king in the centre and preparing Bd6 followed by f4, another 9...h5?! 10.f4! h4? 11.f5! gxf5 12.d5, winning a piece) 10.d5!? (10.Ba3 was also quite logical in Hickl-Kock, Liechtenstein 1992) 10...cxd5 11.cxd5 Bh3 12.f3 Bxg2 13.Kxg2 Na6 14.Be3. Despite deploying the Botvinnik we have reached a King’s Indian structure, but one which is quite pleasant for White. The plan is Qd2 and Rac1, with another important point 14...Ne8 15.g4!. ‘Isn’t that weakening?’ you might ask, but once again the game will revolve around the e4-square after 15...f5 16.exf5 gxf5 17.gxf5 Qxf5 18.Ng3 Qg6 19.Qd2 Nf6 20.Kh1!. White controls e4 and might even be the side who gets to launch an attack down the g-file. Returning to 4...0-0: }
34... c6
{ Black’s second most popular move after 7...Nc6 – see Line 3A. We should also consider: a) 7...Nbd7 might seem natural, but can easily become quite slow for Black, with White’s pawn not on d4, but back on d3: for example, 8.d3 Nc5 (or 8...a5 9.h3 Nc5 10.Be3 with our ideal set-up and after 10...Nfd7 11.Qd2 Ne6 12.f4! Nd4?! we would both struggle not to push the f-pawn rather than bag a pawn with 13.Bxd4!? exd4 14.Nb5, as White did in Fedorov-Obolentseva, Nezhmetdinov Memorial, Kazan 2016) 9.f4 (or 9.h3 c6 10.f4, transposing) 9...c6 10.h3 Ne6 11.f5! Nd4 12.g4 saw White holding back on Be3 to get in his ideal kingside advance in Botvinnik-V.Shcherbakov, USSR Championship, Moscow 1955. Black is already clearly worse and was quickly crushed in brutal fashion by the Patriarch, as we saw back in Chapter Two (‘the d4 break’ and the main game Botvinnik-Szabo). b) 7...a5 8.d3 Na6 is another way of developing the queenside, but still looks a little slow to us: 9.h3 (or just 9.f4!? à la Botvinnik when a model display saw 9...exf4 10.Bxf4 Nc5 11.h3 c6 12.Qd2 Re8 13.Rf2! Ne6 14.Be3 Nd7 15.Raf1 Rf8 16.b3 Rb8 17.d4 and White obtained a huge advantage in Heberla-Carneiro, Torres Vedras 2011; do note Black’s complete lack of counterplay) 9...c6!? (9...Nc5 10.Be3 is pleasant for White, as we saw above) 10.Be3 Nc7 11.f4 (11.d4!? also makes good sense with Black’s knight back on c7, and if 11...exd4 12.Nxd4 Ne6 13.Nde2!, keeping pieces on and intending Qd2, Rad1 and possibly a kingside pawn advance) 11...Re8 12.Qd2 b5 13.cxb5! (keeping control, not allow Black to mix things up with 13.f5 d5!) 13...cxb5 14.Rf2. Again we see this simple and effective plan, and 14...Ra6?! (a slightly strange choice with White’s knight not yet on a4; clearly 14...d5? 15.fxe5 Rxe5 16.Bd4 Re8 17.Raf1 won’t do for Black, but 14...b4 15.Na4 exf4 16.gxf4 Ra6 17.Raf1 is likely only a little better for White who has the black king in his sights) 15.Raf1 b4 16.Nd1 Re7 was very pleasant for White in Doncevic-Lamoureux, Royan 1989, who might now have sounded the charge with 17.g4! (17.f5? is again premature on account of 17...d5, making good use of the knight on c7) 17...exf4 18.Bxf4 Nd7 (or 18...d5 19.e5 Nd7 20.d4 with a very useful space advantage) 19.d4, leaving Black beginning to struggle to breathe. c) While some opponents at club level will want to complete their queenside development, others will want to get in the typical King’s Indian ...f5 break as quickly as possible, as with 7...Ne8 8.d3 f5, but after 9.exf5! (our thematic reaction to ...f5) 9...gxf5 10.Be3 White has a pleasant edge. Qd2 and then f4 or d4 will follow, and here 10...f4?! is nothing to worry about, as shown by 11.gxf4 Nc6 12.Qd2 Nd4 (or 12...Nf6 13.fxe5 dxe5 14.f4!, breaking out) 13.Ng3 Bh3 (this tactic again; never forget about the potential weakness of f3 – and conversely f6 in some lines) 14.f3! exf4 15.Bxf4 Qd7 16.Rae1 with a clear extra pawn. d) 7...Nh5 is a more active way of preparing Black’s main pawn lever, but 8.d3 (plenty of strong players have preferred 8.d4, classically reacting in the centre with Black’s knight on the rim: for example, 8...c6 9.b3 f5 10.dxe5 dxe5 11.Ba3 Qxd1 12.Rfxd1 Re8 13.Rac1 with slightly the more comfortable position for White, who will look to make a well-timed exchange on f5, Pelletier-Ali, Mallorca Olympiad 2004) 8...Nc6 is then standard, transposing to an important sideline we considered back in Line 3A (note ‘a’ to Black’s 8th move). Here you might also wonder about 8...f5, but again this is well met by 9.exf5! gxf5 (9...Bxf5? 10.Bxb7 Nd7 could give Black some play for the exchange, but White can content himself with a clear extra pawn after 11.Bg2 Nc5 12.Be3, and if 12...Nxd3? 13.g4! Nxb2 14.Qd5+) 10.d4 when the centre opens to White’s advantage, not least in the case of 10...e4 (or 10...f4 11.dxe5 when 11...f3? 12.Qd5+ Kh8 13.Bxf3 is an important tactical point) 11.f3! exf3 12.Bxf3 Nf6 13.Bg5 when Nf4 will follow and Black is already under some pressure. e) With 7...c5!? Black imitates us, but has misplaced the king’s knight in the process (it would, like White’s, be much happier on e7, as we’ll see in the next chapter), and after 8.d3 Nc6 9.h3! (useful prophylaxis; 9.f4 again seems a little premature, in view of 9...exf4 10.gxf4 Nh5 followed by ...Bg4 and/or ...f5) 9...Nd4 (a decent attempt to disrupt rather than allow White to proceed full steam ahead with 9...Be6 10.f4) White might break 10.f4!? (we prefer this to 10.Nxd4, even though 10...exd4 11.Ne2 Ne8 12.b4! led to an instructive win for White, as we’ll see in Skembris-Vukic). 10...exf4 (played to avoid being squashed by 10...Nd7? 11.f5 f6 12.h4! a6 13.g4, as in Rakhmanov-Borisenko, World Blitz Championship, St. Petersburg 2018) 11.Nxf4 (11.gxf4?! Nh5 again looks a bit airy for White) 11...Rb8 12.Be3 a6 sees Black limbering up for ...b5. However, White not only has ideas of Qd2 and Nfd5, before or after g4-g5, but also 13.a4! Bd7 (13...b5? 14.axb5 axb5 15.Bxd4! cxd4 16.Nxb5 bags a pawn) 14.b4!, beating Black to the bounce on the queenside and thereby securing a pull, with Rb1 followed by Qd2 set to leave Black struggling to break out. Here Black also has 10...Nxe2+ 11.Nxe2 exf4 12.Nxf4 Nd7, which was pretty sensible in Jakubowski-Piotrowski, Katowice 2018. Now White might look towards the b4 break and after 13.Rb1!? a5! 14.b3 Ne5 15.a3 Nc6 16.Be3 the plan could be Qd2 when all of Rf2, Kh2 and even h4 can be useful moves, all the while looking to go Nd5 at the right moment. f) 7...Be6 is probably the most important alternative when 8.d3 c6 transposes to our main line after White nudges the h-pawn. Instead, 8...Nc6 would take us back to the main line of 3A, while 8...Qd7 9.f4 (9.b4!? is also possible, if you’re happy to seize space and play on the queenside, as with 9...Bh3 10.Be3 Bxg2 11.Kxg2 Ng4 12.Bd2 f5 13.f3 Nf6 14.b5 when White’s kingside is fairly secure and the a-pawn ready to advance) 9...Bh3? (natural, but not good; 9...Nc6 improves when there’s 10.Nd5 and 10.f5!? gxf5 11.Bg5 is a tempting pawn sacrifice we’ve already considered) runs into 10.f5! of course. Now 10...Bxg2 11.Kxg2 c6 (11...Nc6 12.h3 gxf5 13.Rxf5 Ne7 14.Rf2 Kh8 15.g4 b5 16.Ng3 also left White with a dream grip on the position and serious attacking chances in Motwani-Apicella, French League 2005) 12.h3 (preparing the second key advance) 12...d5 (the point of Black’s play, but White can simply ignore the central demonstration) 13.g4! h6 (both 13...d4 14.Nb1 followed by Nd2-f3 and 13...dxc4 14.dxc4 Qxd1 15.Rxd1 scarcely inconvenience White, and if 15...Na6 16.g5 Nh5 17.f6 Bh8 18.Be3 with effectively an extra piece) 14.Ng3 (14.cxd5!? cxd5 15.g5 hxg5 16.Bxg5 Nh7 17.Bh4 would also leave Black in serious trouble due to White’s control over d5) 14...Rd8? (14...dxc4 15.h4! is a lovely idea from Lc0, and if 15...Qxd3 16.g5 Qxd1 17.Nxd1 hxg5 18.hxg5 Nfd7 19.f6 when Black will again find himself effectively a piece in arrears for the rest of the game) 15.cxd5 g5 (15...cxd5 16.g5 hxg5 17.Bxg5 dxe4 18.Bxf6 Bxf6 19.fxg6 would be a massacre) 16.Rh1! cxd5 17.h4 gave White a huge attack on the kingside in Flores-Martinez de Negri, Mar del Plata 2012. Note that 17...dxe4 18.hxg5 hxg5 19.Bxg5 Qxd3 would fail to 20.Bxf6 Bxf6 21.Ncxe4 when the white knights are just too strong. Returning to 7...c6: }
35. h3 $5
{ We’ve followed a battle between two English Opening experts and Scottish-registered GMs, McNab-Turner, 4NCL 2013. Matthew Turner is normally seen on the white side of the Botvinnik and we have no idea how he stumbled into this position. }

{ Or just 8.d3 Nc6 9.h3, transposing. } 8... Nc6 9. d3 Nd4 10. Nxd4 $6
{ Despite the thematic nature and outcome of this game, we don’t recommend this move here. Instead, 10.f4 is our repertoire recommendation, and positional types may also wish to consider 10.Bg5!?, with the idea of 10...h6 11.Bxf6 Bxf6 12.Nxd4 cxd4 13.Nd5 when White has the b4 and f4 advances to play for, and will meet 13...Bg7 14.Qd2 f5?! in trademark fashion with 15.exf5! gxf5 16.f4. }
10... exd4 $6
{ Returning the favour. After 10...cxd4! 11.Nd5 (11.Ne2 a5 is also fairly pleasant for Black, and if 12.f4 Nd7 13.f5 Nc5 when he should be safe enough on the kingside in view of possibilities like 14.g4 Bd7 15.g5 f6!; as such, Tony Kosten suggested 11.Na4, but this remains untested in over-the-board practice, likely because 11...Be6 is fine for Black, when White would find himself overextended in the event of 12.f4? exf4! 13.gxf4 Nh5 14.f5 Bd7) 11...Nxd5 12.exd5 Bd7 Black should have sufficient counterplay. }
11. Ne2 Ne8 12. b4 $1
{ A powerful advance, whereas 12.f4 f5 would rather play into Black’s hands and just be quite unclear, partly because the knight isn’t so happy on e2 when it can’t easily move to f4 or g3. }
12... cxb4
{ This must be critical. Instead, 12...b6?! 13.f4!? would see White changing tack, as of course, 13...f5? 14.exf5 is no longer an option for Black, so he must allow f4-f5. }
13. a3 { A Benko-like, logical and pretty powerful follow-up. } 13... bxa3
{ 13...b5!? 14.cxb5 Qb6 attempts to disrupt, but still looks better for White after 15.a4 a6 16.Bg5!, and if 16...f6? 17.Bd2 a5 18.f4 Bb7 19.f5 when Black is in serious danger of being squeezed to death on the kingside, and that’s without mentioning the dead-point on d4. }
14. Rxa3
{ 14.Bxa3! was probably even better, and if 14...Nc7 15.Bb2 Ne6 16.f4. White is a pawn down, but clearly d4 is weak and he has a certain initiative, which 16...f5 17.exf5 gxf5 18.Bd5 would but maintain. It’s by no means impossible that Qd2, Kh2 and a well-timed g4 could follow, or just Qe1-f2. }
14... Nc7 $2
{ Meek and rather falling in with White’s plans. Black had to seize his chance to set the board on fire with 14...b5! 15.e5 Bd7! when 16.Nxd4 (16.Bxa8? Qxa8 17.Kh2 dxe5 favours Black with the safer king and two pawns for the exchange) 16...b4 17.Ra2 dxe5 18.Nb3 followed by Na5 would have been rather unclear. }
15. Bb2 Ne6 16. Qa1
{ Richard Reti’s favourite square for the queen and a clear sign here that White is doing pretty well. }
16... a6
{ Skembris criticised this, but even after 16...Qb6 17.f4 Black is clearly worse, followed by f4-f5 or 17...f5 18.exf5 gxf5 19.Bd5 Kh8 20.Bxe6 Bxe6 21.Bxd4 Qc7 22.Rxa7, which wins a pawn for starters. }
17. Nxd4 Nc5 $5
{ 17...Nxd4 18.Bxd4 Bxd4 19.Qxd4 would just leave White in charge, with the far superior central control and pressure against Black’s queenside. As such, Skembris wondered about both 17...Qf6 18.Nxe6 Qxb2 19.Nxg7! (19.Nxf8 Qxa1 20.Raxa1 Bxa1 21.Nxg6 Bf6 isn’t so clear, in view of Black’s bishops and a-pawn) 19...Qxa1 20.Rfxa1 Kxg7 21.Rb1, when we have to agree that White is clearly for choice, and even 17...Qb6 18.Rb3 Qxd4!? 19.Bxd4 Bxd4 20.Qa3 Bc5, but Black surely doesn’t have anything like enough for the queen after 21.Qa5 Nd4 22.Rbb1 followed by Kh2 and f4-f5. }
18. Ne2 Bxb2 19. Qxb2 f6 20. Nf4
{ Heading for d5. 20.Rb1 followed by a central advance might have been even stronger. }
20... Rb8 $1 { Black’s only hope is to break out with ...b5. } 21. d4 $1
{ White is provoked, and rightly so. } 21... Ne6 22. Nxe6 $6
{ Hardly terrible and certainly better than allowing 22.Rxa6? Nxf4 23.gxf4 Bxh3!, but 22.Nd5! would have been stronger, retaining piece to keep Black bottled up. There is 22...b5, but after 23.e5! Black is levered open down the long diagonal as White makes good use of that superb central knight outpost on d5. }
22... Bxe6 23. d5 Bd7 24. Rc1
{ It’s logical to want to push through c5, after which White might eventually obtain ideal central control with f4 and e5. }
24... a5
{ After 24...Qc7 Skembris even wondered about 25.c5!? dxc5 26.f4 with dangerous compensation for the pawn in the shape of White’s powerful centre. }
25. Rb3 Qc7 $6
{ Allowing White to invade. Instead, 25...b6! 26.Rb1 a4 27.Rxb6 (27.Rb4? Qc7 28.Qd4 would retain more tension) 27...Rxb6 28.Qxb6 Qxb6 29.Rxb6 Ra8 30.Rb2 a3 31.Ra2 f5 would have left Black with definite chances to hold, as pointed out by the Greek Grandmaster. }
26. Rb6 $1 Bc8 $2
{ Now Black is swept aside by a tsunami. He absolutely had to try 26...Qc5 27.Rxb7 Rxb7 28.Qxb7 Rd8 29.Rb1, grim though this would have been. }
27. c5 $1 { Another powerful pawn break on a dark square. } 27... dxc5 28. d6
Qd8 29. Rxc5
{ Just compare the difference in activity between the two forces! Unsurprisingly Black didn’t last much longer. }
29... a4 30. Rc7 Be6
{ Black’s exposed king would prove his undoing after 30...Bd7 31.e5! fxe5 32.Qxe5 and Bd5+. }
31. Qb4 { Not only attacking the a-pawn, but preparing Bf1-c4. } 31... Rf7 32.
Qxa4 $1 Ra8 { The defence is overloaded in the event of 32...Rxc7? 33.dxc7. }
33. Qb5 Ra6
{ White just picks off a second pawn after this. As such, 33...Ra1+ 34.Kh2 Rxc7 35.dxc7 Qd1 was likely the last try, when Skembris was ready with 36.Qe8+ Kg7 37.Qe7+ Kh6 (or 37...Bf7 38.Qxf6+ Kh6 39.g4 Qg1+ 40.Kg3 Ra3+ 41.Kh4! forcing mate) 38.Qf8+ Kh5 39.g4+ Kg5 40.Rxe6 and wins. }

{ The standard response to an early knight invasion on d4. } 10... Rb8 11. b4
Nxe2+
{ Here 11...b6 isn’t so super-solid for Black, as White can go 12.bxc5 dxc5 13.Nxd4 cxd4 (or 13...Qxd4 14.Nd5, threatening to trap the queen with Bb2 and leaving White somewhat for choice after 14...Nxd5 15.exd5 Bf5 16.Rb3 followed by Bb2 or Bf4) 14.Nd5. Black doesn’t have to give us a handy protected pawn on d5, but 14...Nd7 15.Bf4 is also quite awkward for him, and if 15...e5 (or 15...Ne5 16.c5 b5 17.Bxe5 Bxe5 18.f4 when the passed c-pawn is quite powerful) 16.Bd2 when White enjoys a fine outpost on d5 and threatens both Bb4 and f4. }
12. Qxe2 cxb4 $6
{ This exchange may not look so bad for Black, but rarely works out well for him. 12...Nd7 13.Bd2 b6 (13...b5!? is more ambitious, but White certainly has some pressure on the queenside after 14.cxb5 axb5 15.Rfc1) 14.f4 was a better try, although White must be slightly for choice. His extra space is quite useful and he might bring his knight closer to the kingside by manoeuvring it to e3. }
13. Rxb4 Bd7 14. Bd2 Qc8 15. Kh2
{ The standard way of dealing with the threat against h3. There’s no need to advance the g-pawn just yet. }
15... Qc5
{ White is also clearly better after 15...b5 16.cxb5 axb5 17.Rc1 Qa6 18.d4. His centre is quite an asset and there’s also the simple plan of ganging up on b5, which the a4 break might well help with. }
16. Rfb1 b5 $2
{ Black had to be brave and undo the damage caused by his last move, returning the queen with 16...Qc7. Even this, though, is quite unpleasant after 17.f4 or even 17.e5! dxe5 18.Rxb7 Rxb7 19.Rxb7, breaking through and leaving Black vulnerable along his second rank and on a6. }
17. cxb5
{ Simple and strong, but here White should have paused and remembered some classic advice. Indeed, there was an even better move: 17.d4!, and if 17...Qxd4 18.cxb5 Qc5 19.b6 with a near-decisive advantage on the queenside. }
17... Bxb5 18. Nxb5 Rxb5 19. Rxb5 axb5 20. Be3
{ This is still extremely good for White, having the bishop-pair and a clear target on b5. }
20... Qa3
{ There was no good way to hold on to the pawn in view of 20...Qc6? 21.e5! Nd5 22.Rc1 Qb7 23.exd6, and if 23...exd6? 24.Qf3. }
21. Rxb5 Nd7 22. Rb7 $1
{ The Russian Grandmaster has judged that the upcoming exchange will merely increase his advantage. }
22... Nc5 23. Rxe7 Nxd3 24. Qd2 $1
{ Reminding Black that he now has an isolated pawn on d6, and there’s also a certain threat of Ra7. }
24... Ra8 $2
{ It was better to have to consent to an exchange of queens on c3. } 25. e5 $1
{ Ever the key advance to look out for when the position opens up and our English bishop can really come into its own. }
25... Nxe5 26. Qd5 $6
{ It’s not hard to understand why Kokarev wasn’t keen on 26.Bxa8 Qxa8, but we’re at a loss to explain why he rejected 26.f4, and if 26...Nc4 (or 26...Bf8 27.Rc7) 27.Qd5, winning material. }
26... Rf8 27. Ra7
{ The extra pawn has gone, but White should still be winning thanks to his far superior activity and a certain outside passed pawn. }
27... Qb2 28. a4 { Here we go... } 28... h5 29. a5 h4 30. gxh4 $5
{ A very grandmasterly decision, breaking up White’s pawns, but most importantly leaving Black without any real play against the white king. }
30... Qe2 31. Ra8 $1
{ It’s time to liquidate ahead of running the a-pawn home. } 31... Rxa8 32.

11. Nxd4 Ne6
{ Challenging for control of d4. Black has also tried: a) 11...Bd7 12.f4!? is ambitious, but also justified with Black low on counterplay. He tried to fight back with 12...a5 (or 12...Nxd4 13.Bxd4 e5!? 14.Be3 exf4 15.gxf4 when d6 is weak and White also has ideas of f5) 13.Ndb5! (by no means the only good move, but often a strong possibility when Black has gone ...a5) 13...Ne6 (Black’s problem is that 13...Nxb5? 14.cxb5 Na7 15.a4 leaves him rather cramped, while White has ideas of both e5 and the standard f5 device, likely followed by Nd5 and Bd4) 14.Rc1 f5 in Piorun-Kanarek, Polish Championship, Poznan 2016, but 15.exf5 gxf5 16.Rf2!? b6 17.Rd2 saw White maintain control. Just compare the difference in activity between the two sides here. White might simply increase the pressure with Qe2 and Re1, and the game showed another strong idea: 17...Rb8 18.Nxd6! exd6 19.Rxd6 Ncd4 20.Bxd4 Nxd4 21.Rxd4 Bxd4+ 22.Qxd4 Be6 23.Nd5. Yes, White has lost the exchange, but we really do have to say sacrificed! He has two good pawns for it, a mighty outpost in the centre of the board and much the safer king. Piorun was quick to exploit those assets with 23...h6 24.Re1 Bxd5 25.Bxd5+ Kh7 26.Re6 Re8 27.Rd6! when 27...Re1+ 28.Kg2 Qxd6 29.Bg8+ Rxg8 30.Qxd6 simplified to a winning endgame. b) Somewhat more active is 11...Ne5 12.b3 Ng4, harrying our pieces. However, it’s important to realise that Black is only being mildly annoying in the very short term – he is still rather low on counterplay. Simon calmly regrouped with 13.Bc1 Ne6 14.Nde2! (keeping pieces on, and Black cramped) 14...Nc5 15.h3 Ne5 16.Be3 (back again and we can still ask: where is Black’s counterplay?) 16...Bd7 17.Rb1 (getting off the long diagonal to avoid any accidents) 17...a6 18.f4 (yes, once again a certain tactic was lurking: 18.Qd2? Bxh3!) 18...Nc6. Now in Williams-Dovzaltz, Internet (blitz) 2004, 19.b4!? Ne6 20.Nd5 would have left Black getting horribly squashed, with White set to invade on b6, as well as go f5. Returning to the game’s 11...Ne6: }
12. Nxe6
{ A simple choice, but Simon would later prefer 12.Nde2!, keeping pieces on: for example, 12...Nc5 13.h3 Be6 14.b3 a5 was Nisipeanu-Maze, European Championship, Aix les Bains 2011, when 15.Rb1 would have been sensible, stepping off the long diagonal ahead of pushing f4 and preparing to meet 15...a4 with 16.b4. }
12... Bxe6
{ 12...fxe6!? wasn’t ridiculous, but after 13.Rc1 (13.h4!? is also very tempting, preparing to soften up Black’s kingside with h5) 13...e5 14.f4 White’s extra space should give him a small edge. }
13. Nd5 $5 Qd7 $6
{ Slow. Now Simon takes control in instructive fashion. Black should have preferred 13...Bxb2 14.Rb1 Bg7 15.Rxb7 Na5! 16.Rb4 (clearly the e-pawn is taboo) 16...Bd7 followed by ...e6, with sufficient counterplay. }
14. Qd2 Bh3
{ Black wants to remove our English bishop, but it isn’t all that active here, so White shouldn’t mind the exchange. 14...f5!? is another common idea in such positions, but after 15.exf5 Bxf5 16.Rad1 White has control. He needs to be a little careful about his light squares, but can always go f3 or f4 (to prevent ...Ne5), and might play for central pressure with c5: for example, 16...Ne5 17.Qe2 Rf7 (17...Bg4 18.f3 also keeps everything covered) 18.Bd4 Raf8 19.f3! (Black must not be allowed to invade on f3) 19...Bh3?! 20.Bxh3 Qxh3 21.Bxe5! Bxe5?! 22.f4, which keeps Black out on the queenside while making full use of that mighty knight on d5. }
15. Bh6 $1
{ White is more than happy to copy Black, the g7-bishop enjoying such an open diagonal. }
15... Bxg2 16. Kxg2 Bxh6
{ Once again, 16...f5!? was likely a better try, leaving Black only a touch worse after 17.Bxg7 Kxg7 18.Rae1. }
17. Qxh6 Rac8 18. b3
{ Rarely a bad prophylactic idea as Simon is happy to maintain control. } 18...
Qe6
{ The start of a slightly cumbersome manoeuvre, but it wasn’t easy for Black to create any play on the queenside in view of 18...a6? 19.Nb6, and he would like to do something before f4-f5 squashes him. }

22. Qg4 Rfd8 23. h4 $1
{ Even as a teenager, Simon knew the power of involving Harry in the attack. }
23... Nd4
{ 23...Re8 24.h5 e6 was the alternative, but Black remains under pressure after 25.Ne3 f5 26.Qg5!?, and if 26...fxe4 27.Ng4 when he might well come unstuck on the dark squares. }
24. h5
{ The consistent follow-up. There was also 24.e5!? dxe5 25.fxe5 fxe5 26.h5, again leaving Black under some pressure. }
24... e6 25. Ne3
{ Simon would later regret not going 25.h6!, attempting to swap h6 for f6. After 25...Qf7 26.Nc3 White will simply go Rd1 next and return with his knight to d5 after any weakening ...e5. }
25... f5 { Kahn seizes his only real chance. } 26. exf5 Nxf5 $6

27. hxg6 hxg6 28. Nxf5 $6
{ A little rushed, but a time scramble was brewing. 28.Re2! followed by doubling on the e-file would have left Black suffering. }

{ Threatening to invade with Re6 and forcing Black to find a precise defence. }
29... b5 $2

30. Qd5+ Qf7 31. Re6 $5

{ Complicating the win. A simple path was 35.Qb7+ Rd7 36.Qxc8 Qxg6 37.Qf8+ Ke6 38.Rh6, and the neat 35.Re6+ would actually have led to mate after 35...Qxe6 36.Rh7+. }
35... Qxh7 36. Qe6+ Kf8 37. Rf6+ Kg7
{ Black is going to hide in the corner, but White is still be winning as he can, of course, pick up the queen. }
38. Rf7+ Kh8 39. Rxh7+ Kxh7 40. Qf7+ $2
{ The wrong check. Correct was 40.Qxf5+ Kh8 41.axb3 when White should be winning as he can gradually advance his king and connected kingside passed pawns, all the while keeping the queen as active as possible. }
40... Kh8
{ This was a last-round game and here Simon gave up, agreeing a draw having reached the time control. Of course, White can continue to press after 41.axb3 Rf8! 42.Qxa7 Kg8, but Black would have good chances to hold, having retained his f-pawn, which makes it harder for White to create anything on the kingside and also hide from checks in some lines. }

Qc7 19.h5 would be a standard way to trouble the black king; White might place a fish bone on h6 right in the black king’s throat or even open the h-file, then go Bf3, Kg2 and Rh1) 18.Rfe1 Rfe8 19.Re3! Qc5 (19...e5! was still a better try, while 19...b5 would have been met by 20.cxb5 axb5 21.b4 Qd8 22.a5) 20.Qxc5 dxc5 21.a5, which left Black suffering right across the board, with the pressure continuing in the event of 21...b5?! 22.axb6 Rxb6 23.Ra5. }

That’s because f5 is coming or 21...Rc8 22.Nd5 Bxd5 23.cxd5 Rc5 24.Rxc5 dxc5 25.Rd1 with a fairly powerful centre. }

With c5 on its way, Black is vulnerable on both flanks, so might lash out with 19...f4?!, but after 20.gxf4!? gxf4 21.Bh3 Bxh3 22.Qxh3 White’s king is actually the safer of the two and something like 22...Kg7 23.Rxe8 Rxe8 24.Kf1 Rh8 25.Qf3 retains control, followed by Re1 and Ke2-d1.

Naturally Black doesn’t have to blunder away his bishop on g7, so play may go 11...Qe7 (11...Nd4? 12.d3 Nxf5 13.Be4 overloads the defence to leave Black under pressure after 13...Qe7 14.Bg5 c6 15.Qa4! when Nd5 is one idea, 0-0-0 and f4 another powerful one) 12.Bxc6+!? (shattering Black’s structure and consistent with White’s policy of swift development; the calmer alternative is 12.d3 followed by 13.Qa4) 12...bxc6 13.Qa4 Bxf5! (sacrificing a pawn, as 13...Bd7 14.d3 should favour White, since our king can go long, whereas its counterpart will never be all that happy, in view of 14...0-0? 15.Bg5, picking off h4) 14.Qxc6+ Kf7 15.Qf3!? (15.d3 is a sensible alternative if you don’t like too much mess and then 15...Bxh3 16.Bg5 Bf5 17.Bxh4! a handy tactic to note, overloading the rook on h8) 15...Qd7 16.d4 Bxh3 (critical, but also a pretty brave choice with White opening up the game and Black’s king on f7) 17.dxe5 dxe5 (17...Bg4 18.exf6! Bxf3 19.Rxg7+ Ke8 20.Rxd7 Kxd7 isn’t totally clear, but should favour White, since the h-pawn can be halted, as with 21.Bf4 h3 22.Bh2 Rag8 23.Nf4) 18.Ne4 Bg4 (an only move; 18...Rad8? loses to 19.Rxg7+! Kxg7 20.Qxf6+ Kg8 21.Bh6) 19.Ng5+ Kg6 20.Qc3. The position is extremely unclear, but White is set to go Qc2+, as well as Be3 and Rd1. It’s always important to remember in such positions that Black has done extremely well to navigate the complications so far, and even if he did reach this position over the board, he could easily still quickly lose his way, with such a king position, if also a passed h-pawn. Instead, 10...Nge7 11.exf5 Nxf5 keeps everything defended, but after 12.d3 White is ready to go Bg5! followed by Qd2, Qb3 or Qa4, while 10...Qf6 prepares to drop back to f7 in the event of Nd5. Now 11.Qb3 is one tempting approach, the simple 11.exf5 another, since 11...Bxf5?! 12.Qa4! is quite awkward for Black, as we can see from 12...Nge7 (or 12...Bd7 13.Nd5 Qd8 14.Be4 Nce7 15.Qb3 with a serious initiative, so 12...Kd7!? might even be the best try, not that White can be unhappy after 13.d3 followed by Bg5 or 13...Bxd3 14.c5!, threatening to swing the queen over to g4, as well as to crash through in the event of 14...Bf5? 15.cxd6 cxd6 16.Qb5) 13.Nd5, winning material. }

The key to such a position as White is to remain calm and pick your moment to make any exchanges. }
17... exd4

1. c4 e5 2. g3
{ 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 would be a typical 1...e5 route into the game, Yes, these ‘Modern’ lines do often occur too after 1...e5, which will turn our attention to in Chapter Six. }

{ The key exchange. } 9... Bxf5 10. h3 h5
{ Again we see Black ruling out any g4 advance, but the cure is likely worse than the disease for him. }
11. Be3 Qd7 12. Kh2 Rae8 13. Qd2
{ White’s play so far has been pretty natural. He might now prepare a b4 and queenside advance, possibly in conjunction with Nd5, arranging the d4 break is another possibility, and it’s also possible to simply improve the knights, as we’ll now see. }
13... Nb4 $6
{ This leap is likely too ambitious here. Once more, it’s not so easy to find a great plan for Black, but 13...Be6 would at least angle for ...d5. White has a great many moves here, with 14.Bh6!? a fairly simple one, with the idea of 14...d5 15.cxd5 Nxd5 16.Bxg7 Kxg7 17.Ne4. This does take on an isolated queen’s pawn, but leaves Black with gaping holes on g5 and c5, with White also able to look for a quick d4, opening lines. }
14. Ne4 $1
{ A simple response. 14.d4?! Nc2 15.Rac1 Nxe3 16.fxe3 Bh6 wouldn’t have been so clever. }
14... c5
{ A big decision, but Smyslov didn’t want to retreat and at least the d4 break is now off the agenda. }
15. N2c3
{ A second White knight flows to a good square. Now a3, Rab1 and b4 may follow. }
15... Nxe4 16. Nxe4 Nc6 17. Rab1
{ Continuing to aim for queenside play. 17.Rae1 followed by f4 was the alternative. }
17... b6 18. a3 Nd4
{ The legendary Russian Grandmaster eyes the f3-square, but as so often White has a simple response to the knight leap. }
19. Bxd4 $1
{ By no means White’s only good move (there was also, for instance, 19.Qd1), but thematic and just watch how quickly Black’s position now collapses. }
19... exd4 $6
{ 19...cxd4 was the lesser evil when 20.b4 Kh7 21.h4 Bh6 22.Qa2 is only slightly better for White, who is all set to push the a-pawn. }
20. h4 $1
{ A strong advance, making sure that the kingside stays closed and Black’s dark-squared bishop quite an unhappy piece. }
20... Bf6
{ Black also would have suffered after 20...Kh7 21.b4 Bh6 22.f4, keeping full control, 20...Bg4 21.b4 Bf3 22.Rfe1 Bxg2 23.Kxg2 Qf5 24.f4 when his attempts to generate something on the kingside come to naught, and 20...Bxe4?! 21.Bxe4 Kh7 22.b4 Bh6 23.Qe2 would again leave White with much the better bishop and even ideas of an eventual f4-f5. }
21. b4 Kg7 22. a4 $1
{ A strong advance. White is all set to rip open the queenside with a5 (notice how the bishop on g2 is well placed to support a rook invasion on b7), and while Black can grab the a-pawn without losing d6 in the process, doing so comes at a certain cost. }
22... Bxe4 $6 23. Bxe4 Qxa4 24. Ra1 Qxb4 $6
{ Taimanov continues to grab as many pawns as he can in return for his suffering. The alternative was 24...Qd7 when 25.b5 would have left White with superb compensation. It’s notable that both Stockfish and Lc0 have White as being up by well over a pawn here, and they’re quite right, of course. In short, White has the far superior bishop and the only mobile pawn majority, his three holding Black’s five on the queenside. Let’s see how play might pan out: 25...Re7 26.Ra2 Rc8 27.Qd1 Rc7 (Black digs in for the long haul) 28.Qf3 Qg4 29.Qg2 (naturally White retains the queens – he wants to attack) 29...Re8 30.Rfa1 Ree7 31.f3 Qd7 32.f4 Qg4 33.Rf2 Qd7? (33...Re8 34.Raf1 Rce7 likely has to be tried, with the idea of 35.f5 Rxe4 36.dxe4) 34.f5 gxf5 35.Rxf5 when h5 will fall and with it Black’s entire position. }
25. Rxa7+ Re7 26. Rxe7+ Bxe7 27. Qe2
{ Once again the black king is very much in White’s sights. } 27... Bd8 $2
{ He had to try 27...Qa3 when taking on g6 isn’t so strong as d3 hangs at the end, so White would manoeuvre or even just go 28.f4 Qa7 29.f5, and if 29...gxf5? 30.Bxf5 Rh8 31.Bg6! winning. }
28. Ra1 Rf7
{ Taimanov was clearly relying on this defence, but it’s not only along the seventh rank that White can invade. }

8... Na6 9. h3 Qe8 10. exf5 Bxf5 11. g4 $1
{ Bold and good. Black’s queen will no longer be landing on h5. In contrast, with the queen already on e8, 11.d4?! (a good plan with the black queen still on d8) 11...Qh5 12.g4? Bxg4 13.hxg4? Nxg4 would be most unwise. }
11... Be6
{ Black has also retreated the bishop, but 11...Bg6 12.f4 exf4 13.Nxf4 Bd8 would have been extremely pleasant for White in Hanley-Lane, British Championship, Scarborough 2001, had he now further restricted Black’s pieces with 14.d4, and if 14...Bb6 15.Nxg6 Qxg6 16.Bf4 Rad8 17.Kh1 followed by Qd2, with control and the bishop-pair. Instead, 11...Bxg4? 12.hxg4 Nxg4 13.Ng3 would pretty much just be an extra piece, but 11...Nxg4!? 12.hxg4 Bxg4 isn’t totally ridiculous, even if it looks insufficient to the human eye. White should develop and unpin with 13.Be3 Qg6 14.Qb3, and if 14...Bf3 15.Ng3. There’s a definite threat to capture on b7 and White is also ready to untangle with Bxf3 Rxf3; Kg2, possibly followed by Qd1 if needed or Rae1. }
12. f4 $5
{ A bold and tempting advance, but if you prefer full control at all times, then you could just first go 12.Be3 and only then Qd2 and/or Ng3 ahead of f4. }
12... Rd8
{ This feels a little slow, but is at least preferable to Black’s most common move, 12...exf4, which side-steps f5, but after 13.Nxf4 Bf7 14.Be3 White most certainly could not complain about his extra space and well-coordinated forces in Doeres-Schramm, German League 2006. He is ready to go Qd2 (or even Qb3) and Rae1, after which Black might begin to look a little vulnerable on e6. Alternatively, 12...Bd8 13.f5 Bf7 14.b3 Bb6+ 15.Kh1 Rd8 16.Ne4! maintains control with Bg5 on its way, and if 16...d5! 17.Nxf6+ gxf6 the calm but direct 18.Qe1! Nc5 19.Qh4, which already left Black in huge trouble on the kingside in McNab-Greet, Edinburgh 2009. The Scottish Grandmaster and expert on the English Opening has also faced the prophylactic 12...h6 when 13.Be3 would be sensible, and if 13...Bd8 14.Qd2 Bb6 15.Bxb6 axb6 16.Rae1 followed by f5 and Ng3 or just d4. Finally, we should mention that while no human is yet to venture 12...Nxg4!? 13.hxg4 Bxg4 Stockfish does initially quite like the sacrifice, against which we suggest 14.Be3 Qg6 15.Ne4!, and if 15...Bh4 (15...Bh3? 16.N2g3 maintains control while preparing exchanges: for instance, 16...Bxg2 17.Kxg2 d5?! 18.f5 Qf7 19.cxd5 cxd5 20.Ng5 when White is taking over) 16.Qd2 Bh3 17.N2c3. Black’s only real try here appears to be 17...Nb4!, keeping up the threats while supporting ...d5, but White should remember he is a piece up at this stage. He can force things with 18.fxe5!? d5 (or 18...Bxg2 19.Qxg2 Qxg2+ 20.Kxg2 Nc2, which does regain the material, but after 21.Bd2 Nxa1 22.Rxa1 dxe5 23.Rh1! Be7 24.Rh5 White has the initiative and we slightly prefer his pieces to Black’s extra rook and pawns; clearly e5 is weak and White can also play to target the black queenside after Be3) 19.cxd5 cxd5 20.Bg5! when the position is sharp, but 20...dxe4 21.Bxh4 e3 22.Qe2 Nxd3 23.Nd5 sees White remaining in front and Black beginning to run out of compensation for the piece as White even threatens, on top of a certain check, to try and remove all the rooks down the f-file. }
13. Ng3
{ By no means White’s only good move, but thematic and it can’t be bad to retain the tension. }
13... exf4
{ Black releases the tension only now that White can’t recapture with the knight, hitting the light-squared bishop. One good sign for White is that it’s hard to suggest a viable alternative, as we can see from 13...Nc5? 14.g5 Nfd7 15.f5 Bf7 16.Be3 when Black is simply getting squashed. }
14. Bxf4 Nd7
{ Even after 14...Qd7!? 15.Qe2 d5 White is for choice following 16.d4!, which prevents ...Bc5+ and so wins a piece in the event of 16...dxc4? 17.Rae1. }
15. Qe2 Ne5 16. b3
{ Good prophylaxis and preparation for d4. Instead, the greedy 16.Bxe5?! dxe5 17.Qxe5?! would not have been wise: 17...Rxf1+ 18.Rxf1 Bxc4! regains the pawn with advantage to Black. }
16... Bh4
{ Black removes one of his many pieces from the e-file, but is still going to do well to shake off White’s grip. }
17. Nce4 $5
{ Centralising and threatening Nxd6, while refusing to fear any simplification. }
17... Qe7
{ The tactic 17...Rxf4!? 18.Rxf4 d5 is the possibility mentioned in our last note. White can hit back with 19.cxd5 cxd5 20.Ng5! when 20...Bxg5 21.Qxe5 Bxf4 22.Qxf4 followed by Re1 would retain an edge. White’s knight might yet land on d4 or h5 with some effect and 22...Nc5?! 23.Qd4 Qf8 24.Rc1 would drive Black backwards. }
18. Nh5
{ Side-stepping the potential tactics. A decent case made also be made for 18.d4!? Ng6 19.Bg5, and if 19...Bxg5 20.Nxg5. }
18... Ng6 19. Be3
{ Flores has the threat of Bd4, as well as Bxa7, as the battle begins to heat up. }
19... d5 $5
{ 19...Nc5 would have been a more solid approach, leaving White only slightly for choice after 20.Nxc5 dxc5 21.Bd2 with the idea of Bc3. }
20. Neg3
{ This can hardly be terrible, of course, but 20.cxd5! cxd5 21.Neg3, and if 21...Nc5 22.Bd4 would have avoided the possibility Black now had in the game. }
20... Bxg3 $2
{ Black should not be giving up this important bishop. Instead, 20...dxc4! 21.dxc4 Nc5 would have been fine for him. }
21. Nxg3 Qd6 22. Nh5 $1
{ Renewing the threat of Bd4. Black is going to badly regret the exchange on g3. }
22... Bf7 $2
{ White’s bishop-pair would have been pretty useful after 22...Rxf1+ 23.Rxf1 d4 24.Bg5, but Black was wrong to allow White to carry out the threat. }
23. Bd4 $1 dxc4 24. Bxg7 cxd3 25. Qb2

26... d2 27. Nf6+ $1 { Hitting on the right idea. } 27... Kxg7 28. Ne8+

28... Kh6 29. Qg7+ Kg5 30. h4+ $5

{ The remaining moves in the official gamescore make no sense (33.Nc5?? d1=Q+ 34.Rxd1 Rxd1+ 1-0), so we’ll presume Flores repeated moves then found the mate. }
33. Nf6+ Kg3 34. Rf3+ Kxh4 35. Qh6#
{ Black continues to imitate and is ready to meet 11.Nd5 with 11...b5. Alternatively: a) 10...Nd4?! would just play into White’s hands, in view of 11.Nxd4 cxd4 12.Nb5 Qb6, as in Taimanov-Ljubisavljevic, European Senior Championship, Saint Vincent 2002, where the restrained 13.b3!? might have been White’s best choice, keeping queenside options open ahead of breaking with f4 next move. b) 10...f5 can be met well enough by 11.Nd5, intending Bg5: for example, 11...fxe4 (or 11...h6 when 12.exf5! is thematic, and if 12...gxf5 13.f4 or 12...Bxf5 13.b4 axb4 14.axb4 cxb4 15.Nxb4, creating a long-term target on b7) 12.dxe4 Be6 13.Bd2!? (eyeing the b4 break, as well as f4) 13...Rf7 14.Qc1!? Rc8 (14...Nd4?! 15.Nxd4 cxd4 16.Bg5 is awkward for Black, who after 16...Bxd5 17.cxd5 Qd7 18.h4 will be vulnerable on the light squares after Kh2 and Bh3) 15.Bg5 Qf8 16.Qd2. Now in Pena Gomez-Alonso Rosell, Barcelona 2018, Black could find nothing better than giving up a pawn with 16...h6 17.Bxe7 Nxe7 18.Qxa5. }

Black can deal with his a-pawn with 16...Nc6, but then 17.b4 axb4 18.axb4 Ne7 19.Nb6 Qd8 20.c5! would be one way White might open lines on the queenside, and if 20...d5? 21.Qb3, with a most powerful pin. 12...Nd4!? would be a better-timed leap, but here White has at least 13.Bg5 f6 14.Nxe7+ Qxe7 15.Be3, angling for a favourable exchange of minor pieces on d4, as well as b4. }

Just look at his grip on the c4-, d4- and e4-squares, as well as how after 12...Qe7 13.c4 c6 14.a4 his queenside play is already well advanced, with 14...Be6 15.a5 Nc8 16.Nd2 threatening a6 and already looking rather unpleasant for Black. A better advance might be 11...c5, not that White again has any complaints about seeing the structure with 12.c4! Bf5 13.d3 arise, when a4-a5 is again the plan and Bb2 should swap off Black’s best minor piece. }

{ 12...c5!? 13.dxc5! Na4 might improve and would be a typical Grünfeld idea, but even so White is doing quite well after the calm 14.Be3, preparing to swap c3 for b7, as well as to meet 14...Qc7 with 15.h5!, and if 15...g5? 16.Rxb7! Qxb7 17.Nxg5 Qxg2+ 18.Kxg2 hxg5 19.Bxg5 when the queen and three extra pawns, allied to White’s kingside initiative, should somewhat outclass Black’s extra pieces.

Far from it in fact: the extra sacrifice was the best way of turning his initiative into something very tangible. Note how Flores’s bishops are most well placed to support the c-pawn and, objectively, Black may already just be lost. }
21... Nd6 22. Bxd6
{ Simple chess, but first 22.e3!? might have been even stronger, overprotecting d4 to facilitate Nd2 and leaving White winning comfortably the race scenario after 22...a5 23.Bxd6 exd6 24.Nd2 a4 25.Nc4. }

24. Nd2 $1 Rc7 25. Ne4 Rd8 $2
{ Making matters easy for White and with a highly thematic knight manoeuvre: Nf3-d2-e4-c3-d5. 25...d5 was the last chance, although as both players no doubt realised, 26.Nc3 Rxc6 27.Bxd5 Rac8 28.Bxc6 Rxc6 29.Kf1 Bf8 30.Ke2 Bb4 31.Na2 should be a winning endgame, thanks to White’s far superior king and large central majority. }

16... Nf7
{ Chess is so often about pawn levers and here White has the key break in e4, one which would soon have occurred too in the event of 16...Be5 17.Bxe5 Qxe5 18.Rfe1. And do note too that 16...Bxf4? 17.Qxf4 Qxe2 was not good on account of simply 18.Qd4 Qg4 19.Rxc7. }

20... Ng6 $6
{ Black never manages to free his position after this, but even 20...exd4 21.Nxd4 looks quite unpalatable for him, when Qg4 is again an option and White might also consider pushing Harry to deprive the black knight of squares. }
21. dxe5 dxe5
{ It would also have been fairly one-way traffic after 21...Nxe5 22.Bxe5 dxe5 23.a4 followed by Qb3, Rc4 and Rfc1. }
22. Nd2
{ Heading for the queenside. 22.Rc4!? Rac8 23.Qc2 would also have been good, sooner or later forcing Black’s bishop back to b8. }
22... Rad8 23. Nb3 $1
{ Gawain is alert and avoids 23.Nc4?! c6! when Black would have obtained a somewhat greater degree of freedom. }

{ If 26...Qc8 27.Qe2, but 26...Qe7!? 27.Nxa6 Rd2 28.Bc3 Ra2 29.Ra1 Qg5 would at least have generated a bit of counterplay. }
27. Rxc5 Rd2 28. Bc1 $1
{ Maintaining full control and, sooner or later, one of Black’s queenside pawns is going to fall. }
28... Rd6 29. Qe2 Qb3 $5 30. Ra5 $1
{ Simple chess rather than allowing Black’s devilish point, 30.Qxa6 Nf4+!, even if 31.Bxf4 (31.gxf4?? Rg6+ 32.Kh2 Qf3 would embarrassingly lead to mate) 31...exf4 32.gxf4 Rh6 33.Rh1 Rg6+ 34.Rg5 should also win. }

{ White has calculated everything perfectly and the game is up for Pert. }
35... fxe5 36. Rxd6 Nf8 37. Qc6 Qf7 38. Qd5
{ Our favourite advance, although it should be said that White has also done quite well in practice with 9.d4 exd4 10.Nxd4, and 9.b3 is another quite good move. }
38... Nd7
{ Calm play. 11.Qc2 is also a decent approach, as even might be 11.fxe5!? Nxe5 12.d4, but we would prefer to avoid the weakening 11.a4 even if it does prevent Black’s next. }
39. a4
{ Black’s problem is again 14...Qxa4 15.fxe5 when he shouldn’t have enough for his pawn after 15...Qxd1 16.Rfxd1 Nc5 17.Bb4. }

15... Bxe4
{ A rather committal decision. Black later preferred to rule out ideas of Nh5 with 15...Bg6 in Griffiths-Howell, 4NCL 2012, but here 16.Rc1! would have been quite effective, as shown by Chessable’s own John Bartholomew, and if 16...Rc8 (Black should certainly avoid 16...Nxa2? 17.Nxc5 Bxc5 18.Rxc5 Nb4 19.Qa1, while John liked White’s attacking potential with the bishop-pair after 16...Bxe4 17.Bxe4 f5 18.Bb1!?) 17.h4! Nxa2 18.Ra1 Nb4 19.Rxa7 Nc6 20.Ra1 Nb4 (back again, but it’s hard to spot anything definitely better) 21.h5 when Black really must concede the two bishops, unpalatable though his position would then be, as 21...Bf5 22.h6! g6 23.Nf6+ Bxf6 24.Bxf6 simply creates too major a weakness. }
16. Bxe4 N6d5
{ Black attempts to trade pieces. Perhaps 16...f5 17.Bg2 g6 was a better try, although after 18.Re1!? Bf6 19.Bxf6 Rxf6 20.e4 fxe4 21.Rxe4 White has very much seized the initiative and threatens Bh3. }
17. Nh5 g6

18... Na6 $2
{ The decisive mistake. Black absolutely had to go 18...f5! when 19.Bf3 followed by Nf4 is only a pleasant edge for White, although Navara may also have disliked 19.Bxf5!? Rxf5 20.Rxf5 Qxf5 21.Qxf5 gxf5 22.axb4 Nxb4 23.Rxa7 Rxd2 24.Rxb7 Rxb2 25.Rxe7 when only White has winning chances. }

{ Probably not best, but Black’s most common move as 6.e3 continues to catch plenty of opponents out: a) The second most popular choice has been 9...f6 when 10.f5! shouldn’t come as a surprise to you, cramping Black and hoping to gradually show up ...f6 as a weakening advance: a1) With the bishop on e7, not d6, 10...Nb4?! might tempt some, but 11.d4! favours White: 11...exd4 (or 11...c6 12.g4!? Kh8 13.a3 N4d5 14.Ne4 exd4 15.exd4 Nc4 16.Rf3! with serious attacking chances in Tadic-Paunovic, Vrnjacka Banja 2012; Rh3 and Qe1-h4 is not so easy to deal with) 12.exd4 c6 13.g4! (again a strong advance, opening up the third rank for White’s pieces and giving him a potential battering ram) 13...Bd6 14.Ne4 N4d5 15.Kh1 Bc7 16.Qd3 Re8 17.g5 left Black rather cramped and under heavy pressure in Ponomariov-Potapov, Khanty-Mansiysk (blitz) 2013. a2) 10...Qd3 is also nothing to fear, and if 11.Be4 Qa6?! 12.d3 followed by a3, b3 and perhaps then g4 again. a3) 10...Bd7 can now longer be met so effectively by 11.Ne4, but White has done quite well with 11.d4!?. For example, 11...exd4?! (releasing the tension isn’t so wise with a hole on e6) 12.exd4 Bd6 13.Ne4 Be8 was Ipatov-Nepomniachtchi, European Championship, Legnica 2013, when Richard’s old suggestion of 14.d5! Ne5 15.Nd4 still just looks a very good one, targeting the hole on e6. Instead, 11...Be8!? 12.d5 Nb4 13.a3 Na6 might be best when White can keep the tension with 14.Qc2 or go in for the critical 14.d6! cxd6 15.Bxb7 Nc7 16.Bxa8 Qxa8 17.a4! when Black shouldn’t have quite enough for the exchange with b3 and Ba3 imminent, as well as a5. We should also cover briefly that 11...Bd6 can be met by 12.Ne4 or 12.g4!? Qe7 13.Ne4, after which 13...Nd8 14.Nxd6 cxd6 15.a4! Bc6 16.d5 Be8 17.e4 left Black badly cramped in Berkes-Ruck, Hungarian League 2012, and that 11...Qc8 12.g4 Rd8 13.Qe1 Be8 14.Qf2 exd4 15.exd4 Bf7 16.Bf4 maintained an edge, with Ne4 one idea, preparation for g5 another in Privara-Jasinski, correspondence 2015. a4) 10...a5 is yet another idea we’ve come across before. White doesn’t have to fear ...a4 and might even go 11.b3!? Bd7 (11...a4?! 12.Nxa4 Nxa4 13.bxa4 Kh8 14.d4 is just an extra pawn and a pull) 12.d4, reaching a position we’ll return to explore in Jones-Edouard, 1st matchgame, London 2014. b) The immediate 9...a5 has also been tried, but doesn’t do anything to prevent from White simply going 10.fxe5 Nxe5 11.d4. After 11...Ng6 (11...Ng4 12.h3 Nf6 13.e4 also looks quite promising for White) 12.h4!? we quite like Viktor Mikhalevski’s suggestion of 12...Bg4 (12...Re8 13.h5 Nf8 14.h6 g6 15.Nf4 feels rather risky for Black with such a hole on g7 and 15...Bg5?! 16.e4 Bxh6 running into 17.Nh5!, and 12...h5 13.Bf3 Bg4? 14.Bxg4 hxg4 15.h5 Nh8 16.Nf4 would just be a disaster for the second player) 13.Bxb7, and if 13...Rb8 14.Bf3 when Black shouldn’t have enough for his pawn. }

(18...a4?! 19.Ba3 Qe8 20.Qb2 holds the queenside together, since Black doesn’t really want to allow 20...Na5?! 21.Rac1! axb3? 22.Rxc7 bxa2? 23.Nd6) 19.Ba3 Qf7 when there would have been everything to play for after, say, 20.Qc2 a4 21.bxa4 Nb6 22.d3 Nxa4 23.g5, even if we must admit here to a bias in favour of White’s attacking chances. }
17. g5 $1 Nd7

Nxb2 (26...fxg5? 27.Rxf8+! mates next move) 27.Be4 when Black has no better defence to White’s slow-motion threat than 27...Rd7 28.Nf7 Nxg6 29.Bxg6 Qxf7 30.Bxf7+ Rxf7, but after 31.Qe2 he shouldn’t be able to save the game, up against an extra queen on such an open board. }

{ This move is yet to be repeated, quite possibly because of the drubbing Black now receives. Black might like to set up with ...d6 and ...Nbd7, so decides to avoid having his bishop blocked in, but even with the bishop on b7 he will struggle for counterplay, as we’ll now see. }
7. Nf3 $5
{ There is absolutely nothing wrong with our standard set-up 7.Ne2 Bb7 8.d3 d6 9.0-0 followed by h3 and f4, but the English GM and English Opening expert makes an excellent case for the text move. }

{ It turns out that the knight wasn’t so misplaced for a Botvinnik structure, as White still intends to break with f4. Moreover, Black isn’t now about to get in ...f5, which was possibly one of the ideas behind his slightly mysterious ...Qe8. }

11... a5 12. Ra2 $1

20. Nf5
{ Practically dangerous, but the cold-blooded silicon prefers 20.h5!? Qh7 21.Ba3, with its main line running 21...c5 22.exd5 Qxd3 23.Qxd3 Nxd3 24.Rd1 Ne5 25.Rb2 when White should be doing quite well with his bishops, as shown by 25...Nxc4 26.Nxc4 Bxc4 27.Bg2 Rfd8 28.d6 when a Bxc5 tactic may well follow. }

(12.f4? Nb6 would rather eye the ugly duckling on c4) 12...Nb6 13.Ne3, which may even be a little better for White. He will castle, go Bd2 and then look to break with b4 and/or f4. }

38... g6 $1

Nxd5 (or 28...exf4 29.Qxf4 Ne5 30.Be2 Ng6 31.Qd2 followed by Bd4) 29.cxd5 Qe7 30.Bb5 would have left White in full control, as shown by 30...exf4 31.Qxf4 Bc2 32.Rc1 Ne5 33.h5! followed by Qh6 or Bf2-h4. }
28. Bg2 Rg8 $6 29. Ne3 $1
{ As Richard wrote in his original annotations to this powerful encounter in CHESS, Black has the Sveshnikov from hell, White being in full control of d5 and able to exploit the kingside holes. }
29... Nd4
{ Now White takes over the light squares, but so bad are matters that the engines want to go 29...Rxg2!? 30.Rxg2, partly because 29...Bg6 would have dropped a piece to 30.f5! Bxf5 31.Bd5. }
30. Bxd4 exd4 31. Nxf5 Qxf5 32. Bd5
{ It certainly is a Sveshnikov from hell, Black having lost all the light squares and with his position riddled with weaknesses. }
32... Rxg1 33. Rxg1 Nh6 34. Qb6 Qd7
{ Unfortunately for Black, 34...Qxf4? 35.Qc7 would be an immediate game-ender. }
35. Qxd4 Qe7 36. Ka2 $5
{ Ding is in no rush, content to savour his lovely position. } 36... Nf5 37.
Qc3 b6 38. h5 Re8 $2
{ Even after 38...Ne3 39.Be4! Re8 40.Qd4 Qe6 41.Bd3 Black surely wouldn’t have survived. }
39. h6 $1 Ne3 { Likewise, if 39...Nxh6 40.Re1! Qxe1 41.Qxf6 mate. } 40. Re1
{ Yet again we see White developing as rapidly as possible. } 40... Qe6
{ Natural, as would be 13...Nc6 when White should go 14.Re1 or 14.d5 Ne5 15.Nxe5 Qxe5 16.Bf3 which supplied a definite pull and soon more than that as Black carelessly allowed 16...b6? 17.d6! Rb8 18.d7 Ba6 19.Qa4 in Michalik-Kohlweyer, Groningen 2013. 13...Rd8!? has also been tried and enabled Black to hold in Nakamura-J.Shahade, Seattle 2003, but 14.h3 Bf5 15.Re1 should retain an edge, and if 15...Qf6 16.Bd3 Bxd3 17.Qxd3 Nc6 18.Re4! followed by Rae1. }
41. Rb1
{ As we’ve already seen, this gave the teenage Simon a small but pleasant edge in Williams-Stummer, Budapest 1994. There Black completed development with 15...Nd7 when 16.h3 would have left Black unable to exchange and after 16...Bh5 one sensible idea would be 17.Rb3, preparing to double as well as possibly advance with g4, another 17.Nd2 Bxe2 18.Rxe2 followed by Ne4 and/or Qa4, retaining a pull on account of White’s more active pieces. }

h6 { Ruling out the dangerous Bg5 ideas, but at the cost of a tempo. } 9. Bd3
cxd4 10. cxd4 Bb4+ 11. Bd2 Bxd2+ 12. Qxd2 Nc6 13. Qe3
{ Simple chess, overprotecting d4. You might be concerned that White has the ‘worse’ structure, but does that really matter? The a-pawn is hardly a target, while the hanging pawns on c4 and d4 control a number of useful squares. Factor in White’s grip on e5 and it’s not so hard to appreciate that Black is passive and yet to come close to equalising. }
13... O-O
{ The radical 13...b6!? is proposed by the engines, and if 14.0-0 Bb7 15.d5! (White might also play more slowly with Be4) 15...Nb4 16.Be4. However, after 16...0-0! 17.dxe6 Bxe4 18.exf7+ Qxf7 19.Qxe4 Rac8 they are right to point out that Black has a fair amount of positional compensation, so here White would likely try to fight for the initiative with 20.Ne5 Qf5 21.Qe2 Rfe8 22.f4 Nc6 23.Rae1. }
14. O-O Bd7
{ By now it was too late to fianchetto, as we can see from 14...Rd8 15.Rad1 b6? 16.Qe4, and if 16...Bb7 17.Qh7+ Kf8 18.Be4 Rab8 19.Bxc6! Bxc6 20.Ne5 Ba4 21.Rde1 with some initiative and an immediate threat of d5. }
15. Rfe1
{ White is after more than just the lasting structural edge 15.Qe4 Qf5 16.Qxf5 exf5 17.Rab1 would have supplied. }
15... Rfd8 16. Be4 $5
{ It’s not just the queen which can make good use of e4 as the man nicknamed ‘the Professor’ begins to build up for the d5 breakthrough. }
16... Be8
{ A little passive. After 16...b6?! Black would only have been slightly worse, with White able to choose from 17.Rac1, 17.Rad1 Rac8 18.Qd3, and 17.d5!? exd5 18.cxd5 Na5 19.Ne5!, with this last option leaving him with the initiative. }
17. Rad1 Rd6 $6
{ Black seems ignorant of the classic breakthrough hanging over his position, or perhaps he just miscalculated. White would also have met 17...Rac8 with 18.d5! when 18...Nb4 19.Qb3 Na6 20.Bc2 Nc5 21.Qb4 followed by Ne5 would have kept up the pressure, so perhaps the best defence was 17...Na5!? 18.Qc3 Nc6, pleasant for White though this would have been after 19.Bc2. }
18. d5 $1 { A textbook advance. } 18... exd5 19. cxd5 Ne7
{ Pretty much forced, with 19...Nb4? running into 20.Rd4! Na6 21.Bb1. This carries a certain threat of mate and after 21...Qd8 22.Re4 Bd7 23.Re7 Rxd5 24.Qf4 there doesn’t seem to be any defence on the kingside, as we can see from 24...Be6 25.R1xe6! Rd1+ 26.Re1 or 24...Qf8 25.Qe4, while 24...f5 fails to 25.a3! Kh8 26.Ne5. }
20. Ne5
{ Tomashevsky is not slow to exploit the initiative the breakthrough has given him. }
20... Bb5 $2
{ A misguided bid for freedom. Black needed to dig in with 20...Rad8, and if 21.Nc4 Ra6 when 22.Bc2 Bb5 23.Ne5! Bd7! (Delroy would be too strong in the event of 23...Rxa2?! 24.Qb3 Ra5? 25.d6 Nc6 26.Ng4 Qg5 27.d7) 24.Nxd7 Rxd7 25.Bb3 favours White, but far from decisively so. }
21. Qc5 Rb6 $6
{ Now White crashes through for a second time, but 21...Bd7 22.Nc4 Ra6 23.Qc7 would also have been pretty hopeless for Black. }
22. d6 $1 Ng6
{ Alternatively, if 22...Nf5 23.Ng4 or 22...Nc6 23.Nd7 and wins. } 23. Bxg6
fxg6 24. d7
{ A graphic example of the strength of Delroy after the d5 breakthrough. }
24... Rd8 25. a4 $1 Ba6 26. Nxg6 $1
{ Tomashevsky is determined to finish in style. } 26... Kh7
{ 26...Qxg6? 27.Qc8! Qf6 28.Re8+ would be terminal. } 27. Ne5
{ 27.Nf8+! would have been even neater, and if 27...Rxf8 28.Qc2+ Kg8 29.Re8 Rd6 when White can force the win with 30.Rxd6 Qxd6 31.Rxf8+ Kxf8 32.Qc8+ Kf7 33.Qe8+ Kf6 34.d8=Q+. }
27... Re6 28. Qd5 Re7 29. h3
{ Creating luft and rather emphasising Black’s lack of a good move. Indeed, it’s high time to resign. }
29... b6 30. Qe4+ Kg8 31. Ng4 $1
{ 31...Rxe4 32.Nxf6+ gxf6 33.Rxe4 picks up the exchange for starters. } 1-0
