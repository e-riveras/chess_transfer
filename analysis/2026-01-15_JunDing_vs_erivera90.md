> **⚠️ CRITICAL: Your move allowed the opponent to immediately capture your Black Bishop on b4.**

### Coach Explanation
BLUNDER: You hung your Bishop. The opponent can simply take it with Bxb4. Ne7 worsens your position significantly (-452 cp). Bxd2+ forces a Queen trade, relieving some pressure and leading to a more tenable endgame, even if still slightly unfavorable. You were objectively lost here, but this move might have set a practical trap.

## 3 Key Takeaways

The recurring theme of your error appears to be **tactical oversights under pressure**. While you may have been in a difficult position already, hanging a piece significantly worsened the situation.

Here are 3 things to focus on in your next game:

*   **Double-Check Before You Move:** Before committing to a move, take a moment to scan the board for immediate threats to your pieces, especially from opposing pieces you might have overlooked. Ask yourself, "What happens if they take this?"
*   **Consider Defensive Resources:** When under pressure, look for defensive options, even if they involve sacrifices. Trading material to simplify the position can sometimes be better than losing material outright.
*   **Don't Give Up!** Even when behind, look for ways to complicate the position and create practical chances for your opponent to make a mistake.
