## Moment 1

![Position](images/2026-02-03_erivera90_vs_estelle_leviosa_moment_1.svg)

**FEN:** `r1bn1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b4/4N3/2B1nB2/8/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w - - 2 10`

- **You Played:** **f3** <span style='color:red'>❌ (Red Arrow)</span>
- **Engine Best:** **Re1** <span style='color:green'>✅ (Green Arrow)</span>
- **Eval Swing:** -295 cp
- **Variation:** _Re1 Nc5_

### Coach Explanation
Okay, let's analyze this move. `f3` weakens the position significantly according to the engine. While you ultimately won the game, `f3` was a serious blunder in this position.

The main issue is that it creates further weaknesses in your pawn structure and doesn't address the immediate threats. The engine preferred `Re1` because it likely develops a piece to a more active square while preparing to defend against incoming threats. `f3` doesn't develop anything and doesn't seem to improve your position strategically. While it's possible `f3` presented some tactical possibilities that your opponent missed, objectively you were lost after this move.

## Moment 2

**FEN:** `r4rk1/ppp2ppp/3bbn2/4N3/5B2/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w - - 0 13`

- **You Played:** **Rad1** <span style='color:red'>❌ (Red Arrow)</span>
- **Engine Best:** **Nd3** <span style='color:green'>✅ (Green Arrow)</span>
- **Eval Swing:** -280 cp
- **Variation:** _Nd3 Rad8_

### Coach Explanation
Okay, let's analyze this. While you ultimately won the game, Rad1 was a serious error according to the engine. Rad1 develops the rook, which seems like a reasonable idea, but it doesn't address the immediate threats and tactical vulnerabilities. The engine's preferred move, Nd3, likely improves the knight's position, potentially defending key squares or preparing an attack. Rad1 doesn't accomplish any of that and the position deteriorates.

While Rad1 may have inadvertently created a practical trap that your opponent missed, objectively, you were lost here. Nd3 was the best way to minimize the damage.

## Moment 3

![Position](images/2026-02-03_erivera90_vs_estelle_leviosa_moment_3.svg)

**FEN:** `4rrk1/ppp2ppp/3bbn2/4N3/5B2/2N2P2/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 w - - 2 14`

- **You Played:** **Nb5** <span style='color:red'>❌ (Red Arrow)</span>
- **Engine Best:** **Nd3** <span style='color:green'>✅ (Green Arrow)</span>
- **Eval Swing:** -364 cp
- **Variation:** _Nd3 Rd8 Bxd6 Rxd6_

### Coach Explanation
Okay, let's break down this move. `Nb5` isn't a good move. While you ultimately won the game, at this point you were objectively losing. The engine's strong negative evaluation of `-350` after `Nb5` indicates you handed the advantage to your opponent.

The main problem is that `Nb5` doesn't accomplish anything concrete and likely weakens your position. It probably allows your opponent to improve their pieces or create threats against your position. We don't know the specifics without diving deep, but the engine's evaluation suggests it likely allows your opponent to win material, control key squares, or launch an attack.

The engine's suggestion, `Nd3`, is better because it likely maintains defensive stability and prepares for future action without handing the initiative to your opponent. The suggested continuation `Nd3 Rd8 Bxd6 Rxd6` probably leads to a more even position or perhaps allows White to slowly improve without taking unnecessary risks.

Essentially, while your move may have introduced some practical complications that your opponent couldn't handle, in a perfect game, it would have led to a loss. `Nb5` gave your opponent an opportunity to capitalize on a tactical or positional weakness, while `Nd3` likely avoided those pitfalls and kept you in the game.

## Moment 4

**FEN:** `5k2/p4ppp/2pN4/3bN2n/5B2/5P2/1PP3PP/6K1 w - - 2 21`

- **You Played:** **Nd7+** <span style='color:red'>❌ (Red Arrow)</span>
- **Engine Best:** **Be3** <span style='color:green'>✅ (Green Arrow)</span>
- **Eval Swing:** -532 cp
- **Variation:** _Be3 g5 Nd3 Kg8_

### Coach Explanation
Okay, let's analyze this position.

The player's move, Nd7+, was a mistake because it significantly worsened White's position according to Stockfish, dropping the evaluation by a whopping 532 centipawns. This suggests the check, while seemingly active, doesn't achieve anything concrete and actually *allows* Black to improve their position or create threats. It likely forces the knight into a less favorable square, potentially exposing it to attack or preventing it from fulfilling a more useful role. The check is tactically unsound in this context.

Stockfish's suggestion of Be3 is superior because it improves White's position without giving Black any immediate advantages. Be3 likely serves a defensive purpose, supporting the knight on N5 and controlling important squares. It prepares for future development or tactical opportunities without weakening White's position. In short, Be3 is a solid improving move, whereas Nd7+ gives Black a free tempo.

## Moment 5

![Position](images/2026-02-03_erivera90_vs_estelle_leviosa_moment_5.svg)

**FEN:** `8/p2Nkppp/2pN4/3b3n/5B2/5P2/1PP3PP/6K1 w - - 4 22`

- **You Played:** **g4** <span style='color:red'>❌ (Red Arrow)</span>
- **Engine Best:** **Be5** <span style='color:green'>✅ (Green Arrow)</span>
- **Eval Swing:** -520 cp
- **Variation:** _Be5_

### Coach Explanation
Okay, let's analyze this move. `g4` significantly worsened your position according to Stockfish. While you ultimately won the game, objectively, you were lost here. The move `g4` likely weakens your kingside pawn structure and opens lines for Black's attack, especially with their knight on h5 already eyeing that side of the board.

Stockfish suggests `Be5` as a much better move. Conceptually, this likely achieves a few things: it controls key central squares, it potentially restricts the black knight's activity, and it challenges Black to deal with the bishop, perhaps creating a more complex situation. Your move, `g4`, probably created immediate tactical or strategic problems that your opponent couldn't solve, but it was a gamble from a position of weakness. Essentially, while `g4` might have presented your opponent with a difficult *practical* problem, `Be5` would have been a more *sound* chess move.

## Moment 6

![Position](images/2026-02-03_erivera90_vs_estelle_leviosa_moment_6.svg)

**FEN:** `8/8/2N1k3/5b2/1P6/5pPp/5K2/8 w - - 0 39`

- **You Played:** **Kg1** <span style='color:red'>❌ (Red Arrow)</span>
- **Engine Best:** **Nd4+** <span style='color:green'>✅ (Green Arrow)</span>
- **Eval Swing:** -509 cp
- **Variation:** _Nd4+ Kd5 Nxf3 Kc4_

### Coach Explanation
Okay, let's analyze this. Kg1 was a dangerous move here. While you eventually won, the engine assessment is clear: you were lost.

Moving the King backwards like that simply allows Black to consolidate their position and press their advantage further. It doesn't create any immediate threats or improve your own position. Stockfish wanted Nd4+ because that forces the King to move and creates active play. It disrupts Black's plan, offers a check, and gives you the chance to trade pieces and create counterplay even while being down material. By playing Kg1, you essentially handed Black a free pass. While it led to a win in the actual game, this was likely due to an error by your opponent, rather than a strategically sound move on your part. This move may have presented some practical difficulties or subtle traps that the opponent failed to appreciate.

In short, Kg1 was passive and let Black dictate the pace, while Nd4+ was active and would have injected some much-needed dynamism into an otherwise dire situation.

## Moment 7

![Position](images/2026-02-03_erivera90_vs_estelle_leviosa_moment_7.svg)

**FEN:** `8/8/2N1k3/8/1P4b1/5pPp/8/6K1 w - - 2 40`

- **You Played:** **Nd4+** <span style='color:red'>❌ (Red Arrow)</span>
- **Engine Best:** **b5** <span style='color:green'>✅ (Green Arrow)</span>
- **Eval Swing:** -482 cp
- **Variation:** _b5 Kd5 Ne7+ Ke4_

### Coach Explanation
Okay, let's analyze this. Nd4+ was a mistake. While it looks like an active check, it drastically worsens your position. You were already in trouble, but this makes it much worse. The engine evaluation drops considerably after this move.

The core issue is that Nd4+ allows Black's king to consolidate its position while achieving nothing concrete for White. In essence, you're shuffling your knight into a less effective square while the opponent is improving.

The engine's suggestion, b5, is likely aimed at creating a passed pawn and attempting to generate counterplay by forcing Black to deal with this threat. Even though the engine still sees it as a losing position, it's a *less* losing position than after Nd4+ because it introduces a practical problem for your opponent to solve. Your actual move might have introduced complications or a trap that your opponent missed later, allowing you to win despite being objectively lost.
