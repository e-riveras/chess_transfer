## 3 Key Takeaways

Your performance shows a tendency to make moves that either weaken your position significantly or throw away material, sometimes seemingly in the hope of setting a trap. While the idea of setting traps isn't bad, it's important to prioritize solid positional play and piece development first.

Here's what you can focus on in your next game:

*   **Prioritize Development:** Before making aggressive moves, ensure all your pieces are actively participating in the game. Look for opportunities to bring them out to good squares, especially in the opening.
*   **Strengthen Your Position First:** Avoid moves that weaken your pawn structure or unnecessarily expose your king. Focus on solidifying your position and controlling key squares before launching an attack.
*   **Calculate Before Sacrificing:** Ensure any piece sacrifice is well-calculated and leads to a clear advantage, not just a potential trap. Don't throw away material unless you're absolutely sure it will pay off.
