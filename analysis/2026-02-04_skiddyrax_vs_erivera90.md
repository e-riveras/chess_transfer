**FEN:** `r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/2BQP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6`

- **You Played:** **g6** <span style='color:red'>❌ (Red Arrow)</span>
- **Engine Best:** **Ne7** <span style='color:green'>✅ (Green Arrow)</span>
- **Eval Swing:** -535 cp
- **Variation:** _Ne7 O-O Nc6 Qc3_

### Coach Explanation
Pawn structure. g6 weakens the kingside prematurely and does little to improve Black's position, worsening the evaluation significantly.

- **Eval Swing:** -430 cp
- **Variation:** _Bxe5 Bb5+ Kd8 Nxf7+_

### Coach Explanation
"b6" is a positional error that allows White to maintain pressure and further develop. "Bxe5" immediately exploits the undefended Bishop on c4 and leads to a strong attack after Bb5+, regaining the material and attacking the Black king.

- **Eval Swing:** -505 cp

## Moment 8

![Position](images/2026-02-04_skiddyrax_vs_erivera90_moment_8.svg)

- **Eval Swing:** -3262 cp

## 3 Key Takeaways

It appears a recurring theme in your game was **weakening your pawn structure and overlooking immediate tactical opportunities.** You sometimes made moves that passively defended instead of actively improving your position and creating threats.

Here's what you can focus on in your next game:

*   **Prioritize active piece development and tactical vision:** Before moving a pawn, consider if it creates weaknesses. Always look for hanging pieces and forcing moves like checks, captures, and threats. Ask yourself "What does this move *do*? Is it putting pressure on my opponent?"
*   **King Safety First:** Be extremely mindful of your King's position, especially when making pawn moves in front of it. Before making a move, quickly assess if it compromises king safety or opens lines of attack for your opponent.
*   **Don't shy away from exchanges:** Look for opportunities to trade pieces, especially if it simplifies the position, opens lines for your rooks, or challenges your opponent's central control. Calculating the consequences of trades can lead to tactical breakthroughs!
