### Coach Explanation
f6 weakens the pawn structure and does nothing to address the threat of the knight on g5, leading to a significant evaluation drop. Nh6 develops a piece, prepares to challenge the knight on g5, and the continuation allows for better development.

## 3 Key Takeaways

The recurring theme in your errors revolves around **reactive and weakening moves** under pressure. You tended to make moves that didn't address the root of the problem and often worsened your position.

Here's what you can focus on for your next game:

*   **Prioritize Active Defense:** Instead of reacting to threats passively, look for moves that develop your pieces and simultaneously counter the attack. Ask yourself, "How can I make this threat work for me?"

*   **Evaluate the Long-Term Impact of Pawn Moves:** Before pushing a pawn, especially near your King, consider the resulting pawn structure and potential weaknesses you might be creating.

*   **Develop Before Capturing (Unless Forced):** Resist the urge to immediately recapture or trade pieces, especially if it sacrifices development. Development is key to a solid defense and eventual counter-attack.
