## 3 Key Takeaways

The recurring theme of your errors is **premature aggression and overlooking tactical vulnerabilities.** You often made moves that seemed active but left pieces undefended or weakened your king's safety.

Here's some advice for your next game:

*   **Double-Check Before You Move:** Always scan the board for immediate threats to your pieces, especially before making an aggressive move. Ask yourself, "Can my opponent take this piece?"
*   **King Safety Matters:** Prioritize solidifying your king's position, especially in open games. Don't castle into danger; consider a more defensive option.
*   **Central Control is Key, Unless...:** Fight for the center of the board but don't sacrifice structural integrity or piece safety to do so. Sometimes a more solid defensive approach is necessary, especially when under pressure.

Keep practicing and focusing on these points - you'll see improvement!
