## 3 Key Takeaways

Your game shows a tendency to make moves that weaken your position and/or allow your opponent to gain the initiative. A recurring theme is premature attacks that ultimately lose tempo and hanging pieces.

Here's what to focus on in your next game:

*   **Prioritize Piece Safety:** Before making a move, always double-check that the piece you're moving is not under immediate attack. Look for hanging pieces on both sides.
*   **Develop with Purpose:** Ensure your moves not only develop your pieces but also control important squares, threaten the opponent, or support your pawn structure. Ask yourself "What does this move *do*?"
*   **Calculate Before Attacking:** Before launching an attack, calculate the consequences. Will you gain material, force a weakness, or improve your position? Avoid attacks that are easily defended or leave you worse off.
