## 3 Key Takeaways

The recurring theme in your mistakes is **overlooking immediate threats and tactical vulnerabilities**. You're focusing on your own plans but not adequately checking what your opponent can do in response.

Here's some advice for your next game:

*   **Before each move, do a "threat check":** Ask yourself "What pieces of mine are undefended? What squares are weak around my King? What can my opponent take immediately?".
*   **Always consider captures:** Before making a move, quickly scan the board for any potential captures, both for you and against you. Think "Can I take something? Can they take something?".
*   **Don't be afraid to trade material when necessary:** Sometimes, giving up a piece to avoid a greater loss (like the Queen!) is the best option. Focus on minimizing damage.

Keep practicing! Identifying these areas is the first step to improvement.
