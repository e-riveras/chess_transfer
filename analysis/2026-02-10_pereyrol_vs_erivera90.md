- **You Played:** **Nf4** <span style='color:red'>❌ (Red Arrow)</span>

- **Variation:** _O-O O-O Nf6 h3_

> **⚠️ CRITICAL: Your move allowed the opponent to immediately capture your Black Knight on f4.**

### Coach Explanation
BLUNDER: You hung your Knight. The opponent can simply take it with Bxf4. O-O develops your King to safety, preventing immediate attacks, and prepares to bring your rooks into the game; meanwhile, Nf4 hangs a piece for no compensation and worsens your position significantly.

**FEN:** `r1b2rk1/pp3pbp/2n3p1/q5N1/2B2B2/2P5/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 14`

- **You Played:** **Be6** <span style='color:red'>❌ (Red Arrow)</span>
- **Engine Best:** **Bxc3+** <span style='color:green'>✅ (Green Arrow)</span>
- **Eval Swing:** -350 cp
- **Variation:** _Bxc3+ Kf1 Bxb2 Rb1_

> **⚠️ CRITICAL: Your move allowed the opponent to immediately capture your Black Bishop on e6.**

### Coach Explanation
BLUNDER: You hung your Bishop. The opponent can simply take it with Bxe6. Bxc3+ forces the King to move, wins a pawn, and opens the b-file for an attack. You were objectively lost here, but this move might have set a practical trap.

## 3 Key Takeaways

The recurring theme in your mistakes is neglecting piece safety and overlooking simple captures. You're giving away material without sufficient compensation.

Here's what to focus on in your next game:

*   **Before every move, double-check:** Is any of my pieces undefended? Can my opponent simply take something for free?
*   **Prioritize King Safety:** Develop your king early. Castling protects your king and connects your rooks, setting you up for a stronger middlegame.
*   **Think Before You Attack:** While aggression is good, make sure your attacks are well-calculated and supported. Avoid speculative sacrifices or moves that leave your pieces vulnerable.
