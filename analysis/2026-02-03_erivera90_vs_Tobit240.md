## 3 Key Takeaways

The recurring theme seems to be **Tactical Awareness and Material Valuation**. You need to better assess the immediate consequences of your moves, particularly regarding material exchanges.

Here's what you can focus on in your next game:

*   **Calculate Material Trades:** Before making a move, count the material being offered/taken and ensure you're coming out ahead (or at least not behind). Practice simple exchanges like Queen for Rook vs Queen for Pawn.
*   **Queen Safety:** Be extra cautious when moving your Queen. Always double-check if it's under attack or vulnerable to tactical combinations. Ask yourself, "Is my Queen safe here?".
*   **Prioritize Piece Activity:** Look for moves that improve the activity of your pieces (especially your Queen!) while simultaneously protecting them from danger.

Keep practicing and focusing on these areas – you'll see improvement in no time!
