1. c4 { Welcome to the world of the English Opening! It’s an opening which can be traced right back to that great English player of the Victorian era, Howard Staunton. Wherever possible we’ll also be looking to put to good use a set-up within the English favoured by the legendary fifth world champion, ‘the Patriarch’, Mikhail Botvinnik. The world hasn’t been an amazing place of late, but lockdown allowed time for plenty of filming, streaming...and internet blitz. Simon even did a spot of a chess work for himself, realising that while some of his old favourites were in need of an overhaul, they were very much still as dangerous as back when he first started playing them many years ago. In recent years Simon has played a lot of 1.d4, but he will most certainly once again be employing his old love, the English, a fair bit more from now on. Let’s see why! } 1... e5 { Black’s main move. Play transposes after } ( 1... Nf6 2. Nc3 { if Black now pushes his e-pawn two squares, but a very popular alternative is } 2... g6 { , going for a King’s Indian-style set-up. We too have our own favourite set-up and the Botvinnik is very handy for countering the King’s Indian, which remains an extremely popular choice at club level: } 3. g3 Bg7 ( 3... d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 { would be Grünfeldy, but } 5. Bg2 { is quite dangerous; White can even deploy one of our favourite early advances, pushing Harry! } ) 4. Bg2 O-O 5. e4 d6 6. Nge2 e5 7. d3 { This is the Botvinnik set-up, giving White a firm central grip and control over d5. White will castle next and may then aim to cramp Black with a quick f4-f5. An important and super-solid alternative for Black is } ) ( 1... c5 { , the Symmetrical English. Here too we can aim for our favourite set-up: } 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. e4 Nf6 6. Nge2 O-O 7. O-O d6 8. d3 { This position can come about via a great many move orders, including a King’s Indian one, but once again White’s central grip is obvious to the eye. Key pawn levers to bear in mind are f4-f5, b4 and d4. After } ) ( 1... Nf6 2. Nc3 { Black can be a little annoying with } 2... c5 ( 2... e6 { is another important line, beloved of Nimzo-Indian players, but we don’t have to allow their fun and can go } 3. e4 { , the dangerous Mikenas Attack } ) 3. g3 d5 { , which denies us a Botvinnik set-up, but after } 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. Bg2 { it’s hard to complain about White’s lovely bishop. Just look at that bishop on g2 swooping down the long light-square diagonal! We’ll also look at a few tricky initial moves, including Simon’s old favourite, } ) ( 1... f5 { , as well as } ) ( 1... b6 ) ( 1... c6 { and especially } ) ( 1... e6 { , all of which aim to deny us our Botvinnik formation, but do little to prevent a quick e4 from White. } ) 2.

Bxc3 4. bxc3 d6 5. Bg2 { when, yes, you guessed it, a Botvinnik formation is on the cards, but our recommendation is actually } ) ( 2... Nc6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. e4 { sees our ideal set-up once again in action. Black doesn’t have to go King’s Indian style with } 5... d6 6. Nge2 Nf6 { here, but in any case White has his central grip and may break with f4. } ) 3. g3 Bb4 { A big alternative is } ( 3... d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. Bg2 Nb6 { when we’re suggesting that White avoids the main lines of the reversed Dragon with } 6. e3 { , again bringing the king’s knight to its favourite English square, e2. The resulting positions are relatively unexplored, but certainly dynamic – and fun! Not only may White break with d4, but also f4. } ) 4. e4 $5 { This idea championed by the champ himself, Magnus Carlsen, is likely to surprise your opponent and is actually a pretty decent choice. Once again, a Botvinnik set-up is White’s plan and } 4... Bxc3 5. dxc3 Nxe4 { doesn’t win a pawn due to } 6. Qg4 { , hitting the knight and g7. Before we get to tackle this line and all Black’s possibilities in detail, it’s time to learn some of White’s key ideas. Read on! } *

1. c4 e6 { The choice of some Queen’s Gambit players. You may well be happy with } 2. e4 $5 { This is likely to surprise opponents, taking play not into the QGD, but the French Defence! } ( 2. Nc3 d5 ( 2... Bb4 3. Qb3 { should lead to an edge } ) 3. d4 { , possibly because you have experience with the fairly easy-to-play and pretty decent Exchange variation, } 3... Nf6 { or } ( 3... Be7 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bf4 ) 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 { . However, we most certainly don’t have to transpose to 1.d4 territory or even opt for a Reti set-up with } ) ( 2. Nf3 d5 3. g3 { or } ( 3. e3 ) ) 2... d5 { Black’s main choice, but not all 1...e6 players are also French fans. Those who don’t play 1.e4 e6 might well deviate at this point and } ( 2... c5 { has been seen in just over a quarter of games to have reached this position. The good news for White: } 3. Nc3 { takes us back into the realm of Line 7A and may well result in a Botvinnik set-up after all. Other moves make little sense, with White ready to go 3.d4, although we dare say a case might be made for } ) ( 2... e5 $5 { when } 3. Nc3 Nf6 { after } ( 3... Bc5 { you can either head for a Botvinnik set-up with g3 and g2 or even consider } 4. d3 Nc6 5. Be3 $5 { when } 5... Bxe3 6. fxe3 d6 7. Nf3 Nf6 8. Be2 O-O 9. O-O { would enable White to expand on the queenside and/or consider ideas of e1 and h4 } ) 4. f4 $5 { is a decent version of the King’s Gambit, as we saw at the start of our coverage of the Mikenas Attack. } ) 3. cxd5 exd5 4. exd5 Nf6 { Just as in the Caro-Kann lines of 9A, } ( 4... Qxd5 { would see Black losing time with his queen and, e.g. } 5. Nc3 Qd8 { or } ( 5... Qd6 6. d4 Nf6 7. Bc4 Be7 8. Nge2 $5 O-O 9. O-O { with easy development and ideas of f4, as well as of seizing space with d5, and } ) ( 5... Qa5 6. Bc4 Nc6 7. d4 Bb4 $6 8. Ne2 Nge7 9. O-O O-O { , as in Miezis-Lie, Gausdal 2003, can be met by } 10. a3 Bd6 11. Nb5 { , hunting down the bishop-pair and potentially also embarrassing the black queen } ) 6. Bc4 Nf6 7.

Bb5+ $5 { Just as in our last section there’s nothing wrong with 5. c3, but the text move may wrong-foot even experienced French players and has been championed by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave no less. } 5... Nbd7 { The most ambitious and most common response. Black simply wants to go ... e7, ...0-0 and regain his pawn after ... b6. Instead, } ( 5... c6 $6 6. dxc6 Nxc6 7.

Bb3 Nxd5 { regains the pawn, but after } 9. O-O Be7 10. d4 Qd6 11. Nbc3 { White’s lead in development is quite useful, and if } 11... Nxc3 12. bxc3 O-O 13. Bf4 ) ( 6... Be7 7. Nc3 O-O 8. Nge2 $5 Bf5 9. Ng3 Bg6 10. O-O Nbd7 11. f4 $1 Nb6 12. d3 { left Black’s bishop in trouble in Cao-Hoang, Balatonlelle 2001, and } ) ( 6... b5 $5 { might be met, not by } 7. Be2 $1 ( 7.

Nxc3 14. bxc3 h6 15. Bh4 g5 $5 16. Bg3 { would be a risky idea for Black, with e1 and e5 on their way. } ) 7. d4 { It’s also possible to go } ( 7. Nf3 { and only then 0-0 and d4. } ) 7... O-O 8. Nf3 Nb6 { Regaining the pawn, but White should not be too unhappy, with the use of e5 and fairly active pieces. } 9. h3 $5 { MVL’s patented approach, playing to restrict Black’s light-squared bishop. } 9... Bf5 { Instead, } ( 9... Nfxd5 { feels a little strange, moving the knight away from the defence of Black’s king. He can try to equalise with } 10. O-O c5 { , but after } 11.

Bc4 $1 { White was able to pressure f7 and so maintain a nagging pull in Wojtaszek-Dziuba, Katowice (rapid) 2019. } ) ( 9... Nbxd5 { would be a more conventional way of regaining the pawn, as MVL has twice faced at blitz: } 10. O-O Bf5 { or } ( 10... c6 11. Bd3 h6 12. Re1 Re8 13. a3 Be6 14. Ne5 { when White was ready to go f3-g3 in Vachier-Lagrave-Sargissian, Warsaw (blitz) 2012 } ) 11. Re1 Bb4 12. Bd2 c6 13. Bc4 Bxc3 14. bxc3 Ne4 { was rather ambitious from Black in Vachier-Lagrave-Caruana, Paris (blitz) 2016, where he was quickly outplayed: } 15. Rc1 Qf6 16. Ne5 Rfe8 17. f3 Nd6 $6 ( 17... Nxd2 18. Qxd2 Rad8 19. a4 { is easier for White to play with ideas of b2 and a5-a6, but should objectively be OK for Black } ) 18. Bb3 Be6 $6 19. Qe2 h6 20. Qf2 Nb6 21. c4 $1 { when c3 and d5 was one idea, f4 another, and Black was quickly crushed in short order. } ) 10. O-O a6 11. Bd3 { Exchanging off Black’s most active piece. } 11... Bxd3 12. Qxd3 Nfxd5 13. Re1 Re8 14. Bd2 { Straightforward development from White, who might now centralise with ad1 and e4-c5 or consider ideas of e5 and f5. Once again, Black is OK from an objective viewpoint, but his position is slightly the harder to play, as quickly became apparent in Vachier-Lagrave-Bacrot, German Bundesliga 2012: } 14... Nxc3 15. bxc3 Bf6 16. c4 $1 Qd7 $6 17. Bg5 $1 Qc6 18. Bxf6 Qxf6 19. Qb3 { Black is under pressure with c5 one threat, e5 another possibility and Bacrot lasted only another 13 moves. } *
